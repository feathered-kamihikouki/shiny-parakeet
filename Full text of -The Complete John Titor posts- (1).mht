The First Fax (July 29,1998):=20


http://www.strangerdimensions.com/2012/12/05/john-titor-the-first-fax/=20

"Dear Art,=20

I had to fax when I heard other time travelers calling in from any time pas=
t the year 2500 AD. Please let=20
me explain.=20

Time travel was invented in 2034. Off-shoots of certain successful fusion r=
eactor research allowed=20

scientists at CERN to produce the world's first contained singularity engin=
e. The basic design involves=20
rotating singularities inside a magnetic field. By altering the speed and d=
irection of rotation, you can=20
travel both forward and backward in time.=20

Time itself can be understood in terms of connected lines. When you go back=
 in time, you travel on your=20
original timeline. When you turn your singularity engine off, a new timelin=
e is created, due to the fact=20
that you and your time machine are now there. In other words, a new univers=
e is created.=20

To get back to your original line, you must travel a split second father ba=
ck, and immediately throw the=20
engine into forward without turning it off.=20

Some interesting outcomes of this are:=20

One, you meet yourself. I have done it often, even taken a younger version =
of myself along for a few rides=20
before returning myself to the new timeline and going back to mine.=20

Two, you can alter history in the new universe that you have just created. =
Most of the time, the changes=20
are subtle. Sometimes, I'll notice car models that don't exist, or books th=
at come out late.=20

The oldest one was a skyscraper that wasn't built in a near favorite store =
of mine in New York.=20

Interestingly, when you travel in time, you must compensate for the orbit o=
f the earth. Since the time=20
machine doesn't move, you have to adjust the engines so you remain on the p=
lanet when you turn it off.=20

Unfortunately, it was also discovered that anyone going forward in time, fr=
om my 2036, hit a brick wall in=20

the year 2564.=20

Everyone who has ever been there has reported that nothing exists. When the=
 machine is turned off, you find=20
yourself surrounded by blackness and silence.=20

Now, most time travelers are trying to find out where the line went bad by =
going into the past, creating a=20
new universe, and proceeding forward to see if the same thing results in 25=
64. It appears the line went=20
bad around the year 2000. I'm here now, in this time, to test a few theorie=
s of mine before going forward.=20

Now, for the future you might want to know about.=20

One, Y2K is a disaster. Many people die on the highways when they freeze to=
 death trying to get to warmer=20

weather .=20

Two, the government tries to keep power by instituting marshall law, but al=
l of it collapses when their=20
efforts to bring the power back up fail.=20

Three, a power facility in Denver is able to restart itself, but is mobbed =
by hundreds of thousands of=20
people and destroyed. This convinces most that maybe we shouldn't bring the=
 old system back up.=20

Four, a few years later, communal government system is developed, after the=
 constitution takes a few=20
twists .=20

China retakes Taiwan, Israel wins the largest battle for their life, and Ru=
ssia is covered in nuclear snow=20
from their collapsed reactors.=20

Art, the reason I'm here now is because I believe a nuclear weapon set off =
by Iraq in the Middle East war=20
with Israel might have something to do with the damaged timeline. I will te=
st that theory and get back to=20
you .=20

Please pray that we discover the reason why there is no apparent future aft=
er 2564."=20

The Second Fax (1998):=20


http://www.strangerdimensions.com/2012/12/17/john-titor-the-second-fax/=20

"Dear Mr. Bell,=20

I am glad you're back. I faxed this information to you the day before you l=
eft the air. I wanted to make=20
sure it wasn't lost in the shuffle so I am sending a gift. If you've alread=
y seen this please accept my=20
apologies. If you choose to make this public please do not publish the fax =
number. I had to fax when I=20
heard the other time traveler calling in from the recent time past in fact =
the year 2500 Ad.=20

Let me explain, Mr. Bell. I sent a fax with this opening on July 29 1998. A=
s I said then I am a time=20
traveler. I have been on this world line since April of this year and I pla=
n to leave soon. Typically time=20
travelers do not purposely affect the world lines they visit. However, this=
 mission is unusually long and=20
I've grown attached to some of the people I have met here.=20

Anyway, for my own reasons I have decided to help this world line by sharin=
g information about the future=20
with a few people in the hope that it will help their future. I am contacti=
ng you for the same reason.=20
Unfortunately there is no historical reference to your program in my worldl=
ine.=20

I believe you can change your future by creating one now.=20

Some of the information presented on your program may be invaluable to up-l=
ine researchers. I suggest you=20
isolate the programs that concentrate on military technology and new physic=
s theories. Transcribe these=20
programs and put them someplace safe away from the box. I recommend somepla=
ce in the midwest.=20

I also urge you to reconsider your paranoia to the Russians.=20

They are not preparing for war with the average US citizen. They are prepar=
ing for war with the US=20
government. They will eventually save this country and the lives of million=
 of Americans.=20

I realize my claims are a bit difficult to accept so I will send the follow=
ing once I know you have=20
received this fax. A few pages from the operations manual of my time machin=
e. And a few colored=20
photographs of my vehicle.=20

If you wish to contact me I will be happy to share with you the nature of t=
ime, the physics of time travel=20
and some of the events of your future.=20

Please send a return package to..."=20

TimeTravel_0 : Sorry.. .time machine.=20

TimeTravel_0 : I was sent back to 1975 to get a computer.=20

TimeTravel_0 : Its an IBM model 5110.=20

TimeTravel_0 : My grandfather worked on it.=20

G=C2=B0 : because...?=20

TimeTravel_0 : Thats why I was sent.=20

TimeTravel_0 : We need it in 2036 to recode UNIX which dies in 2038.=20

G=C2=B0 : who needed a 5110? and why?=20

G=C2=B0 : lost me there, don't enough about computers=20

TimeTravel_0 : the 5110 is able to read the old IBM mainframe code.=20

TimeTravel_0 : Its the first protable computer produced by IBM.=20

TimeTravel_0 : Actually its about the size of a small table.=20

TimeTravel_0 : We need on in 2036.=20

G=C2=B0 : so have you tried changing the past yet? or have you found that=
=20
everything you do..=20

G=C2=B0 : has already been done?=20

TimeTravel_0 : Hmmm.. .physics .=20

TimeTravel_0 : Actually. .. world lines are not fixed.=20

TimeTravel_0 : They are all different.=20


4=20








TimeTravel_0 : There is no one "time".=20

G=C2=B0 : but you have a past... you remember things, and if one changes...=
?=20

TimeTravel_0 : Yes...=20

TimeTravel_0 : but they are different.=20

TimeTravel_0 : The fact that I am here changes this world line.=20

G=C2=B0 : so you havn't tried mucking with anything?=20

TimeTravel_0 : No... but I could.=20

TimeTravel_0 : Its just not that moral in my opinion.=20

TimeTravel_0 : Besides...Im not here for that.=20

G=C2=B0 : thing is, you might not have changed anything because you already=
 were here=20
TimeTravel_0 : Thats right!!!=20

TimeTravel_0 : Very good.=20

TimeTravel_0 : In fact..I've noticed samll changes.=20

G=C2=B0 : I mean you upstairs asleep wouldn't have known if you now was=20
downstairs=20

G=C2=B0 : you have? thats what i was getting it=20
TimeTravel_0 : No... he knows me.=20

TimeTravel_0 : Yes... small changes.=20

G=C2=B0 : care to give an example?=20

TimeTravel_0 : Sure...=20

TimeTravel_0 : Football ....( sorry) games that were lost that should have =
been won.=20

TimeTravel_0 : Incidental news stories that havent happened.=20

TimeTravel_0 : Books not written.=20

TimeTravel_0 : Small stuff like that.=20

G=C2=B0 : wow. surely that can't be anything to do with you?=20

TimeTravel_0 : No.=20

TimeTravel_0 : By definition, this world line is not the same as mine.=20

G=C2=B0 : so how come do you think?=20

TimeTravel_0 : Physics.=20

TimeTravel_0 : Have you ever been in a room that has mirrors on all the wal=

I will tell you a littlke story.=20

When time travel was invented.=20

They built prototypes that would go back in time for a split=20
They had sensors and cameras on them.=20

...and they never returned.=20

G=C2=B0 : and forwards as well? how about a single jump forwards?=20

TimeTravel_0 : It was later discovered that the machines were ending up=20
in the air.=20

TimeTravel_0=20

: The Earth was rotating away from them,=20
synchroniaztion please=20

A system had to be invented that would "hold" the machine to the Earth.=20

Its called VGL .=20

Its based on very sensative clocks and gravity sensors.=20

It stops the time distortion machine if radical changes in gravity are dete=
cted,=20

THE PARADOXES...=20

If you went back in time and visited your granny during her ninth birthday =
don't kill her! Because if you=20
put a gun to her head and pull the trigger she could not have given birth t=
o your mum. YOU certainly were=20
never born...=20

Therefore you could not have killed anyone as you never existed. Now this m=
eans your granny couldn't have=20
been killed by you. She didn't die nine years old. This permits you to be b=
orn.=20

If you were born could you go back and kill your granny? No, not your real =
granny. This general idea has=20
been used in Back to the future. Marty nearly stops himself from being born=
 when he prevents his parents=20
from falling in love.=20

Solving The Problem=20

1, You simply can't change history meaning if you go back in time you have =
no free will(as shown in Twelve=20
Monkeys, Crime Traveler etc. Events will get in your way if you try to kill=
 your granny. YOU CAN'T DO IT.=20

2, When you so-called change history you're actually moving up a different =
branch in time into another=20
universe. The previous universe (where you were born) still exists. When yo=
u fire the gun you're really=20
killing another version of your grandmother.=20

3, Any actions you make in the so-called past has no affects on the present=
. It's a different time-line=20
universe.=20

The laws true solutions don't present real time-travel as you go into anoth=
er world.=20

Conclusion=20

We can't simply use the grandmother paradox to rule out time-travel claimin=
g it causes logical=20
inconsistencies. We need to look at all the possibilities.=20

How could we build a time machine?=20

The mathematics of general relativity suggest that under extreme conditions=
 space-time might become so=20
warped it would be possible to travel back in time. There is also the possi=
bility of tunnels in time=20
created by negative mass.=20

Very long rotating cylinders of matter-proposed by Frank Tipler=20

Kerr's spinning blackholes-since most stars spin this becomes worth looking=
 (proposed by Roy Kerr).=20

Cosmic strings-(as Richard Cott suggested)=20

Travelling faster than light - would take us back in time(as suggested by s=
olutions to relativity).=20
Wormholes might allow us to outpace light (if you walk through the short cu=
t quicker than light through=20
convential (normal) space.=20

Tachyons -are sub-atomic particles which always travel faster than light an=
d therefore move back in time=20
constantly. They have not yet been found and remain hypethical.=20

Contracting Universe- Time might then be running backwards but since everyt=
hing else also would it's=20
unsuitable.=20

Macro-wormholes(Kip Thorne showed how we could use it as a time machine).=
=20

time - paradox=20

Paradoxes=20

Grandfather paradox=20

Suppose you could go back in time, lets say several decades and found your =
grandfather when he was two=20
years old. In his house you could grab a knife and stab him to death. He do=
esn't get the chance to have=20
children with your grandmother. Therefore either your mother or father does=
n't get born. Your parents=20
can't give birth to you because one of them don't exist. You could never ha=
ve been born and don't even=20
exist. But could your grandfather have been killed by someone who doesn't e=
xist? He must have lived=20
through his childhood. This would allow you to exist if this is the case. S=
eemingly you can go back in=20
time to commit the murder if you are born but then you would never have bee=
n born. And so on and so on.=20
This situation is not consistent with itself. It doesn't make sense and can=
't possibly happen.=20

Solutions=20

1, You simply can't change the past. Time will stop you limiting your freed=
om while you're in the past from=20
your point of view. This puts the concept of freewill in serious danger esp=
ecially if you tell people=20
what's going to happen to them in their future. If you believe when you go =
back in time you are from one=20
possible future from everyone else's point of view they can simply go up an=
y root in time they want.=20

According to quantum physics Many Worlds theory there are a huge amount of =
universes where every=20

possibility occurs between them all. In some you're the opposite sex. In so=
me you won the lottery etc.=20

You might be heading towards the universe you originally came from before y=
ou travelled back in time.=20
Everything will happen the way you remember it. But all the people you meet=
 are free to decide what they=20
want to do and enter a different universe. Since it's not possible for you =
to be there you disappear from=20
their lives. Meeting a time traveller from your future could therefore be v=
ery strange.=20

2, A parallel universe might be created when you seem to change the past. I=
magine if time itself was just=20
like a tree. The different branches show different ways events could have h=
appened. Every time we decide=20
to do or not to do something time splits. Even if we are not aware we decid=
ed something it have affects.=20
Quantum physics reveals a many worlds theory like this.=20

Conclusion=20


12=20



Since this parallel universe is not really your past (despite it's first ap=
pearance) anything you do there=20
does not affect you. You can prevent a version of yourself from being born =
because you are not really=20
related to anyone there. They just look very like your family and friends. =
You are not home! You may be=20
somewhere that looks like the place you live but a different universe in qu=
antum physics is a completely=20
different reality.=20

3, No matter what you do in what is really a parallel universe you will do =
back to your previous universe=20
which is not affected by your previous actions. A space-time wormhole could=
 lead you back to your original=20
unaffected universe.=20

What came out of the wormhole if the ball never went into it?=20

Another common example of a paradox is a ball that goes through a wormhole =
connected with a moment in the=20
past. Therefore it comes out of the other space-time wormhole mouth actuall=
y before it went in! Then what=20
might happen? If the ball then hits it's younger self out of the way of the=
 mouth then it never goes in.=20
But if the ball never did go in the wormhole then how can it ever come out.=
 The existence of the older=20
version of the ball is destroyed i.e. it never falls back in time. But then=
 this version certainly can't=20
hit the younger version out of the way. So it must go into the wormhole as =
a collision with it's older=20
self is evidently the only force that could and did stop the ball from ente=
ring the wormhole. This of=20
course is unexplainable and is logically inconsistent.=20

But the situation could happen differently to allow it to become self consi=
stent.=20

1, What if after the ball comes out of the wormhole at an earlier time it d=
oes hit it's previous self but=20
this collision is what makes the ball fall into the mouth in the first plac=
e! It hits the other version=20
into the mouth. This would imply that the past or present is affected by th=
e future. In fact in this case=20
the past is dependant on the future.=20

2, The ball might simply hit it's other self only slightly so the direction=
 of the ball is not altered=20
enough to cause a paradox.=20

3, The ball might just miss it's younger self.=20

Nature might protect time and prevent paradoxes. From theories and many sto=
ries it's clear that paradoxes=20
cannot happen in the real world.=20

Other types of paradoxes=20

In the terminator movies John had something important to tell Sarah. Thank =
her for her help through the=20
hell. Tell her not to give up or he will never exist.=20

Who wrote the speech?=20

John certainly didn't write it. He was told it since he was a kid from Sara=
h who could remember it. Sarah=20
just recalls what Kyle told her in 1984. Kyle just remembered what John tol=
d him to say.=20

Conclusion=20

No one wrote it. It exists somehow but not by John, Kyle or Sarah being cre=
ative. No one had to write it=20
because it was created by the affect the future on the past had on each oth=
er.=20

If I in 2000 study the history of work done in a private factory and learn =
about the development of a time=20
machine! Their scientists worked from designs and plans noted in a book (ne=
ver published)they used. They=20
had no idea how to achieve such technology until they read it.=20

Then to experiment with temporal(time) paradoxes I am sent back to 1983. Th=
e entire building has not even=20
been built as I arrive. Later accidentally I meet one of the scientists and=
 talk to him. When I hear how=20
excited he is I hand him that book which he uses future success. The answer=
s! He is more than willing to=20
read and use the book.=20

But who came up with the idea of how the time machine is built?=20

Not any of the scientists as they just followed instructions in that book.=
=20

Not me as all I did was hand a scientist a book. Noone actually wrote the b=
ook and no one had to work it=20
out.=20

Is this allowed by physical laws?=20

Noone really knows...=20

Let's get away from travelling to the past for a moment. Let's look at what=
 was made popular in Back to the=20
Future pt 2, where Marty sees his son, or his girlfriend sees herself.=20

It cannot happen! If you left time, you would be considered 'missing', or d=
ead. The truth is, you don't=20
exist from the point in which you lept forward in time. You therefore canno=
t see yourself, or your son,=20
because you stopped existing at that point in the past where you left.=20

Is this a proper paradox? Is there any reasoning I am missing that says you=
 can see your future self?=20

True. If you leave this time, you will not be here until you return. But, i=
f you are aive in the future as=20
you were alive in the past, then you could visit yourself because you are t=
here. Your present self is=20
different from your past or future self. This definitely applies to the pas=
t because you know you lived in=20
the past and if you can go there, then you can visit yourself.=20

I think there is two ways to look at this Jiga Watts. The first one is wher=
e you can actually change the=20
past so it effects the future. If you were presumed dead in the future, the=
n you could go back to the time=20
right after you left and nothing would have been changed. However if you le=
ave again, it will just be the=20
same as before. The second one is where you can't change the past, and you'=
ll only be creating a parallel=20
universe. What used to be your future is now your present, and since what u=
sed to be your present is now=20
your past, you can't change the past, so you'll still be presumed dead at w=
hen you left off. And so you=20
can still go back in the past and live there as usual, you won't be changin=
g the future. I think that's=20
how those theories go.=20

It is very interesting what would happen if you left the present and reache=
d the future. In The Time=20
Machine the time travelers asks about himself and people claim he went miss=
ing when he left on his journey=20
through time.=20

It seems like an BTTF2 Marty was taken away in 1985 so his kids and everyth=
ing couldn't exist in 2015...=20

But the existance of his kids might just be evidence that they will later r=
eturn to 1985 to do all those=20
things! This would imply that everything they are going to do have already =
been decided!=20

It became clear the the future is NOT set as Doc claimed the future hasn't =
been written yet. So how could=20
they travel into what does not exist? Even when Marty went to 1955 he must =
have been from the future from=20
some people's point of view?=20

The future they travelled to might just have been one possible future! In t=
he quantum many worlds theory=20
there are an infinite amount of futures where every possibility occurs...=

In response to 1.21 jiga-watts. If you go into the future and see yourself,=
 then by rights you will succeed=20

Questions for timetravel_0 with permission to post.=20

Pamela:=20

by the way can you tell me what it feels like to time travel? when you arei=
n the process of doing it what=20
does it feel like and what do you see andhear. you made mention that you ha=
d to get use to the fields. Do=20
you see abright flash of light?=20

Timetravel_0:=20

Interesting first question. The unit has a ramp up time after the destinati=
on coordinates are fed into the=20
computers. An audible alarm and a small light start a short countdown at wh=
ich point you should be secured=20
ina seat. The gravity field generated by the unit overtakes you very quickl=
y.You feel a tug toward the=20
unit similar to rising quickly in an elevator and it continues to rise base=
d on the power setting the unit=20
is working under .At 100% power, the constant pull of gravity can be as hig=
h as 2 Gs or more depending on=20
how close you are to the unit. There are no serious side effects but I try =
to avoid eating before a=20
flight.=20

No bright flash of light is seen. Outside, the vehicle appears to accelerat=
e as the light is bent around=20
it. We have to wear sunglasses or close our eyes as this happens due to a s=
hort burst of ultraviolet=20
radiation. Personally I think it looks like your driving under a rainbow. A=
fter that, it appears to fade=20
to black and remains totally black until the unit is turned off. We are adv=
ised to keep the windows closed=20
as a great deal of heat builds up outside the car. The gravity field also t=
raps a small air pocket around=20
the car that acts as your only 02 supply unless you bring compressed air wi=
th you. This pocket will only=20
last for a short period and a carbon sensor tells us when it's too dangerou=
s. The C204 unit is accurate=20
from 50 to 60 years a jump and travels at about 10 years an hour at 100% po=
wer.=20

You do hear a slight hum as the unit operates and when the power changes or=
 the unit turns off. There is a=20
great deal of electrical crackling noise from static electricity.=20

Pamela: 1. what are some of your memories of 2036?=20

Timetravel_0: I remember 2036 very clearly. It is difficult to describe 203=
6 in detail without spending a=20
great deal of time explaining why things are so different. In 2036, I live =
in central Florida with my=20
family and I'm currently stationed at an Army base in Tampa. A world war in=
 2015 killed nearly three=20
billion people. The people that survived grew closer together. Life is cent=
ered around the family and then=20
the community. I can not imagine living even a few hundred miles away from =
my parents. There is no large=20
industrial complex creating masses of useless food and recreational items. =
Food and livestock is grown and=20
sold locally. People spend much more time reading and talking together face=
 to face. Religion is taken=20
seriously and everyone can multiple and divide in the heads.=20

Pamela: 2. can you send me more of the manual?=20

Timetravel_0: I will considering it but I do not expect they are worth anyt=
hing to most people except as a=20
curiosity.=20

Pamela: 3.what would happen if you would meet yourself on another world lin=
e?=20

Timetravel_0: It has always surprised me why that concept is so hard for pe=
ople to imagine and accept.=20
Nothing would happen. The universe would not end and there are no paradox p=
roblems that threaten=20
existence. Temporal space-time is made up of every possible quantum state. =
The Everett Wheeler model is=20
correct. I have met and/or seen myself twice on different world lines. The =
first was a training mission=20
and the second is now. I was born in 1998 so the other "me" is 2 on this wo=
rld line. There is a saying=20
where I come from....Every possible thing that can happen or will happen ha=
s already happened somewhere.=20

Pamela: 4.How is this world line different from your own?=20

Timetravel_0: For starters.... the fact that I'm here makes it different. I=
've also noticed little things like=20
news events that happen at different times, football games won by other tea=
ms...things like that. I would=20
guess the temporal divergence between this world line and my original is ab=
out 1 or 2 percent. Of course,=20

the longer I am here, the larger that divergencebecomes from my point of vi=
ew.=20

Pamela: 5.1s the vehicle a jeep?=20

Timetravel_0: No...its a 1967 Chevrolet..=20

Pamela: 6.Are you having normal dreams right now? any out of body experienc=
es? drawing you to different=20
times? Do you dream you wake up in other places and other times?=20

TimeTravel_0: No strange dreams or other experiences. Everything is pretty =
much the way I expected it.=20

Pamela: 7.are you able to control where you go or is it random?=20

Timetravel_0: Yes, it can be controlled. However, the distortion unit has o=
perational limits. Imagine your=20
path through time is through a cone. The farther away from the center of th=
e cone, the more differences=20

you will see in the world line. The C204 begins to "break away" at about 60=
 years. This means the level of=20

confidence drops rapidly after 60 years of travel and the world line diverg=
ence increases. In other words,=20
if I wanted to go back 2000 years and meet Christ, there is a better than a=
verage chance I would end up on=20
a world line where he was never born. The computer units and gravity sensor=
s "record" your trip and you=20
are quite easily able to return to your point of origin. I am aware that re=
search is being done on faster=20
units with more accurate clocks. I imagine that they will be able to go bac=
k farther with a higher degree=20
of divergence confidence.=20


16=20




Pamela: 8. are you feeling drawn back to your own time or are you stable in=
 this world?=20

Timetravei_0: I'm not sure what you mean by stable. If you mean mentally...=
there are many things that bother=20
me here but being with my parents right now is important to me. Physically,=
 the only thing really wrong is=20
the number of colds I get.=20

Pamela: 9.Are you able to go back to your own world line?=20

Timetravei_0: Yes.=20

Pamela: 10.how are you protecting yourself from radiation? it alters DNA if=
 you dont.=20

Timetravel_0: I'm not sure what radiation you mean. If you mean from the un=
it, you can see it vents X-rays=20
and Gamma radiation out of the rear. As long as you stay away from that, yo=
u should be okay. I keep a=20
radiation detector with me to check my environment and make sure the unit i=
sn't "leaking".=20

Pamela: 11.How long would you say that ultraviolet radiation lasts? about 1=
0 seconds? and when you are in=20
that light can you see anything around you or does the light kind of "fill =
up" everything and that is all=20
you can see at the time?=20

Timetravel_0: The light bending only lasts a second. Its like driving under=
 a tunnel and being in total=20
black.=20

Pamela: 12.Do your people know where you are right now? Can you communicate=
 with them? do you have a=20
biological implant?=20

Timetravel_0: No. They do not know where I am and I can not communicate wit=
h them. Interesting idea though.=20
From their point of view, I will return almost exactly at the same moment I=
 left. From their viewpoint, I=20
will only have aged more than expected.=20

Pamela: 13. after the flash of light is gone are you then in another time? =
What does it look like as the=20
new time unfolds? Is it just there? or does it slowly come into view? does =
it fade in and out for a time?=20

Timetravel_0: While the machine is on. Everything is black. When the machin=
e is turned off, it is the=20
reverse affect. It appears you are driving out from a bridge. To tell you t=
he truth, I'm usually sleeping=20
when the unit turns off but yes...it does appear that the world fades in fr=
om black.=20

Pamela: 14. what happens if the device messes up? Do you end up in space? i=
f it goes offline and shifts ?=20
does a hole open elsewhere?=20

Timetravel_0: Good question!!! That one almost never comes up. The hard par=
t of traveling through time is=20
not the bending of gravity but the plotting of your course and holding to t=
he basic "position" in your=20
environment. This is done through a system called VGL (variable gravity loc=
k). Basically, the unit takes a=20
reading of the local gravity and samples it during the "trip" in pulses. If=
 the gravity is too far off,=20
the unit stops or reverses itself to the last sample period where the readi=
ngs were correct. If there is=20
some sort of failure, the unit shuts down and drops out to where ever you m=
ay be.=20

Pamela: 15. what affects are caused on the immediate area where the gravity=
 has been distorted after you=20
leave it and when you arrive? are there permanent effects left on the land =
such as electromagnetic=20
disturbances in that area?=20

Timetravel_0: Another good question!!! The only real physical trace is a la=
rge chunk of ground missing from=20
the point of origin and a large pile of dirt at the destination. The gravit=
y field surrounds a small=20
portion of the earth under you and takes it along for the ride. There is re=
ally no way around this.=20

Please feel free to post these if you wish.=20

In response to Shadow:=20

Perhaps it's a bit easier to understand why time travelers do not revel the=
mselves.=20

Yes, you can travel forward in time. No, you do not need an "invite" from t=
he future. I first saw the car=20
in 2036. The idea was to find a vehicle that would not draw too much attent=
ion for the time period.=20
Unfortunately, there were not very many suitable vehicles around in 2036 an=
d I sold the car when I arrived=20
in 2000.=20

You do not rewrite history. I can only affect what happens here just as eas=
ily as you can. Why do people in=20
this time period worry so much about time traveler's destroying their world=
 line when they have no problem=20
doing it themselves every day?=20

My goal is not to be believed. Most people do not take news of the war very=
 well but I find that everyone=20
believes it's inevitable. Even in your own history, are not great invention=
s and discoveries made during a=20
time of war in your effort to kill and main in new and more efficient ways?=
=20


17=20





No, I do not work for GE or any other company. Are "stock tips" really the =
first thing you want to know=20
about in the future? As a representative of your time period, do you realiz=
e what that says about you? You=20
should probably know that this time is not remembered for its selflessness,=
 charity or ability to work=20
together .=20

Why would I want to talk to you? Why don't you believe you have something i=
nteresting or worthwhile to say=20

Hey TimeTravel_0!!!=20

So then what you're saying is that our current computer models are wrong ab=
out Glacial and Polar Ice Cap=20
melting, even though they are going by our current emmisions rate and proje=
cted emmisions of the growth of=20
fossil fuels consumption?? While Global Warming is factually happening and =
even if we stopped burning=20
fossil fuels today and stopped destroying the rain forests today, the impac=
t that is already altered our=20
planetary climate would not stop today as the ball is already rolling. The =
toxins in the ozone layer and=20
the earths lessening inability to creat oxygen, due to the catastrophic dai=
ly destruction of the rain=20
forests that give us most of our oxygen, would take longer than beyond the =
year 2036 to repair itself,=20
even with our help. I find it amazing that if you throw a WWIII into the eq=

Yes, I realize people become hostile. I don't expect anyone to believe me a=

take no offense by it. Just out of curiosity, if you were a time traveler, =
what do you think it would take=20
to get people to believe you?=20

I suppose we could agree that no particular era in history is famous for it=

just once I would like to hear questions like, "What is family life like in=
 the future? How does society=20
deal with poverty? Is AIDS, abortion and drug use still a problem?"=20

Why don't I give you a stock tip? The money you make would dilute the intel=
ligence and forethought that a=20
smart person had in picking the stock all by themselves. If I told you how =
to get rich, I would be taking=20
money from them and giving it to you.=20

Getting back to my "proper" universe is tricky but possible. Yes, another j=
ump would take me to a different=20
family.=20

Cement block...good question. The hard part of traveling to other world lin=
es is just that. There is a system=20
of clocks and gravity sensors that sample the environment before dropping o=
ut. Its called VGL, (variable=20
gravity lock). If a cement block were there, the machine would "backtrack" =
until it sensed relative=20
congruity to the original gravity sample. A great deal of time and effort g=
oes into picking just the right=20
spot since you can not physically move during a displacement.=20

TimeTravel_0-=20
Greetings :=20

Please keep in mind a couple of points as I answer your questions. First, I=
 am not a physicist. "Time=20

travel" is only a tool that allowed me to do my job 1975. Most airline pilo=
ts are probably not aerospace=20
engineers. Second, let me give you an example of the position we are in. Im=
agine you live in the year 1900=20
and a "time traveler" attempts to explain how a jet engine works. Even thou=
gh the invention of the=20
airplane is only a decade inthe future, he would have to find some frame of=
 reference to explain the=20
basics of flight. Then, he would have to outline the mechanics of how the e=
ngine works. As amazing as it=20
would sound, the jet would be invented about thirty years later.=20

Pamela: 1. can you explain to me in detail the basic physics and mathematic=
s behind how the machine=20
operates? and exactly how it distorts gravity.=20

Timetravel_0 : 1) Time travel is achieved by altering gravity. This concept=
 is already proven by atomic=20
clock experiments. The closer an observer is to a gravity source (high mass=
), the slower time passes for=20
them. Traveling at high speeds mimics this effect which =3D the twin parado=
x of faster than light travel.=20
However, this type of gravity manipulation is not sufficient to alter your =
world line.=20

The basic math to alter world lines exists right now. Tipler first describe=
d a working "time machine"=20
through his theory of massive rotating spheres. I apologize for the web sit=
e but it was the only one I=20
could find quickly.=20

http : // www. geocities .com: 0080/Area51/Station/5763/time . html=20

Certain types of black holes also exhibit the "time travel" abilities of Ti=
pler cylinders. Kerr was one of=20
the first to describe the dual event horizons of a rotating black hole. As =
with Tipler 's cylinders, it was=20
possible to travel on a "time-like" trip through a Kerr black hole and end =
up in a different world line=20
without being squished by the gravity of the singularity,=20

http://www. leonllo .f reeservers . com/blackworm.html=20
http ://www. astro . ku . dk/~cramer/RelViz/text/geom_web/node4 . html=20

The mass and gravitational field of a microsingularity can then be manipula=
ted by "injecting" electrons=20
onto its surface. By rotating two electric microsigularities at high speed,=
 it is possible to create and=20
modify a local gravity sinusoid that replicates the affects of a Kerr black=
 hole.=20

For those asking how come a microsingularity doesn't swallow the Earth or w=
ant to know details about the=20
size, stability, mass, temperature and resulting Hawking radiation from suc=
h a thing. . those details I=20
must keep to myself.=20

Pamela: 2. can you travel to the future as well as the past? my understandi=
ng of the machine is the trip is=20
recorded so you can get back to your original time line but what about a fu=
ture beyond your time line are=20
you able to access it as well? or does it have to be open by a future chron=
onaunt?=20

Timetravel_0 : Yes, you can travel into the future and it takes less energy=
 than going into the past.=20

Pamela: 3.1 dont see the computer in the device, is it the hand held device=
 on the side of the larger=20
device? If so what kind of power supply does the computer work off of is it=
 the battery as well or some=20
type of crystal?=20

Timetravel_0 : The computer system is connected to the unit through an elec=
trical bus. There are actually=20
three computers linked together that take the same signals from the gravity=
 sensors and clocks. They use a=20
Borda error correcting protocol that checks the integrity of the data and t=
rips the VGL system.=20

Pamela:4.Is your DNA remaining stable in this world or does it shift? does =
time traveling affect your body=20
or aura or spirit in any way you know of?=20

timetravel_o : 4) I am not aware of any physical change to my DNA or "aura"=
. I do however seem to be more=20
susceptible to colds.=20

Pamela: 5. when you go back to the future will we remember you?=20

Time travel_0: Yes, you will remember me if you want to. World lines do not=
 change that way and I will only=20
become a insignificant part of your history.=20

I would equate the "future" GM distortion units to their current jet engine=

. Yes, compared to now, we do=20

timetravel_0: A typical day...hmmm. Life has changed so much over my lifeti=
me that it's hard to pin down a=20
"normal" day. When I was 13, I was a soldier. As a teenager, I helped my da=

timetravel-0: Yes...there is a post office. The internet is still alive and=
 well in the future. People spend=20
more time talking because life is more centered around the community. I've =
noticed the same type of effect=20
here when the power goes off. People tend to come out of their homes and ac=

timetravel_0: When I'm with my parents, I live in a community made up of "t=

pamela: 6.what started the war? and who fought in it? who won?what countrie=
s were destroyed and what=20

timetravel_0: Wow...that's a big question. There is a civil war in the Unit=
ed States that starts in 2005.=20

That conflict flares up and down for 10 years. In 2015, Russia launches a n=
uclear strike against the major=20
cities in the United States (which is the "other side" of the civil war fro=
m my perspective), China and=20
Europe. The United States counter attacks. The US cities are destroyed alon=
g with the AFE (American=20
Federal Empire) ...thus we (in the country) won. The European Union and Chi=
na were also destroyed. Russia is=20
now our largest trading partner and the Capitol of the US was moved to Omah=
a Nebraska,=20
pamela: 7.did you ever discover what aliens were and ufos?=20

timetravel_0: No new information there. I find that an interesting subject =
myself. Personally, I think=20

pamela: 14. what are your schools and universities like?=20

timetravel_0 : After the war, early new communities gathered around the cur=

timetravel_0 : Most of my memories growing up are not fond. Life was very h=
ard. Simple things make me happy=20

 is used like painting is=20

gy that you use? solar power?=20

timetravel_0 : Yes we have phones but the service is through the web. Most =
power generation is localized. It=20
amazes me how much power is wasted now. Yes, solar is big. There is thought=
 that a singularity generator=20

pamela: 18. what is the dress style of the time what do you wear on your bo=
dies as a style?=20

s common. Dress is much more=20

 no one in this time dresses=20

 when they're in active=20
military service.=20

major ice sheets. It will take about a thousand years for warming in the at=
mosphere to reach the bottom of=20
the oceans. The resulting thermal expansion "would continue to raise sea le=
vels for many centuries after=20
stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations". Even if global warming is =
halted within a century,=20
thermal expansion will eventually raise the oceans by between 0.5 and 4 met=
res.=20


24=20






Even more alarming is the fate of the ice that covers Greenland. Among all =
of the world's ice sheets, this=20
is now thought to be "the most vulnerable to climatic warming". It contains=
 enough snow and ice to raise=20
sea levels by about 7 metres if it melts. And this looks increasingly likel=
y to happen.=20

Models show that after any warming above 2.7 =C2=B0C, "the Greenland ice sh=
eet eventually disappears". Nearly=20
all predictions show Greenland warming more than this, says the report, and=
 the faster the warming, the=20
faster the melting. An extra 5.5 =C2=B0C would cause sea levels to rise by =
3 metres over a thousand years. An 8=20
=C2=B0C warming would cause a 6-metre rise in sea levels in the same time.=
=20

The report's authors are not allowed to discuss their findings until public=
ation. But Jonathan Gregory of=20
Britain's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Bracknell, w=
ho co-authored the chapter on=20
sea level, told New Scientist recently that once under way, the disintegrat=
ion of the Greenland ice sheet=20
would be "irreversible this side of a new ice age".=20

The fate of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which is perched on submerged isl=
ands, remains controversial,=20

says the report. If it melted, it would raise sea levels by a further 6 met=
res. Some experts quoted in the=20
report predict that the sheet could entirely disappear within 700 years. Ot=
hers, supported by the authors,=20
expect that the sheet will contribute "no more than 3 metres" to sea level =
in that time.=20

If sea levels were 10 metres higher than today by the year 3000, it would c=
ause the inundation of a total=20
area larger than the US, with a population of more than a billion people an=
d most of the world's most=20

Contrary to popular belief, and certain speculations here, the plain simple=
 fact is, ther ARE no paradoxes.=20
There never have been and there never will be. The term itself is an oxymor=
on and an invention of the=20
intellect of the human mind, in search of creative thought and outright fan=
tasy. The Universe exists=20
without either the need for, or possibility of them.=20

Once one comes to this simple realization, one can then put the concept of =
"Time Travel" in IT'S proper=20
perspective. Namely, that as is usually thought of, it doesn't exist. Never=
 has, never will. For the=20
simple reason that our invented concept of time itself is fundamentally fla=
wed. Time is not an entity. It=20
is a unit of measurement invented by man, to define the interval between ca=
use and effect. Like Meter. Or=20
Yard. Or Foot. Or pound. Can we "Meter" travel? or "Foot" travel? Or perhap=
s "Acre" travel? Gets silly=20
doesn't it. Why does anyone think you can actually "Time" travel?=20

Interesting that the so called "Twins Paradox" was not discussed in depth h=
ere, but then it's really not a=20
paradox at all. It is only beleived to BE one by people who do not understa=
nd the simple laws of physics=20
and the Theory of relativity.=20

If anyone is interested, I can show you how it CANNOT be a paradox. Unless =
you already know. In which case=20
you wouldn't be here speculating on the "how" of something that doesn't exi=
st in the first place.=20

It isn't that Time Travel is not possible, it's that there is NO SUCH THING=
 in the first place. Never has=20
been. Never will be. Like the Gods of MT. Olympus. Or the Fire Breathing Dr=
agons of old. And Pegasus. Or=20
the Earth as the Center of the Universe. It's mythology. Based on INNOCENT =
ignorance. It's a skewed=20
concept created by a lack of understanding of the fundamental Theories of r=
elativity (General and=20
Special), in the first place. And it doesn't require "Multiple" Universes t=
o solve. If there are multiple=20
universes, than there MUST be an INFINITE number of them. In which case, al=
l things that have ever=20
happened, will happen, are happening Now. If THAT'S the case, what makes an=
yone think they have anything=20
resembling free will at all?=20

Alas, I'm afrid even THIS attempt to resolve the so called "paradoxes" of T=
ime Travel is also a pursuit in=20
search of what is a non-existant problem in the first place. Another lapse =
into inventing a new mythology.=20

There is only ever one "time period" to communicate in. This one. The "now"=
.=20

In the classic so called "twins paradox", the two are always in the same ti=
me line.=20

Visualize the traveling twin doing this travel always in sight of Earth. Or=
biting the Sun at near the spped=20
of light. He is always visible from Earth via telescope and radio. Although=
 there will be some doppler=20
shifting in his image and radio signals, communication is nevertheless stil=
l possible. Just difficult. He=20
is traveling for what seems to be his Earth bound twin's span of 50 years. =
During his voyage, he ALSO=20
counts the Earth rotating around the Sun 50 times! Yup. That's the way it w=
orks. Yet when he finally lands=20
back on Earth, he has aged only 5 years! Relativity has slowed his BIOLOGIC=
AL clock, relative to his twin.=20
Not time itself. Just like it slows the atomic clock on the moving jet plan=
e, relative to the one left on=20
the ground. Gravity has little or nothing to do with it. It is the differen=
ce in RELATIVE velocity that=20
produces what gets measured as time dilation. The same is tru for the twins=
. Actually, neither twin left=20
the other's time line. Both were always in the same one. Both counted 50 re=
volutions of the Earth around=20
the Sun, but the travelers biological CLOCK ran slower. That's all.=20

There is no paradox. And communiction across "time periods" is only ever co=
mmunication across the same time=20
period.=20


27=20









Where I am now, it's 11:30 AM. But in Japan, it's 4:30 TOMMORROW MORNING. B=
ut me and the Japanese are still=20
in the same time line, time period (in the greater sense), and can communic=
ate with each other just fine.=20

The past has gone by. The future hasn't happened yet. And all the near ligh=
t speed travel or power sources=20
that alter matter can't change that. It's a rather fundamental law of the u=
niverse.=20

Even Einstein only ever said time running backwards during faster than ligh=
t travel, MIGHT be possible. He=20
NEVER said for sure that it was true or for certain WOULD occur. And even w=
ithdrew further and further=20
from this original position as he got older.=20

In the pure scientific sense, we need to always be vigilant as to the diffe=
rence in what constitutes=20
hypothesis, and what constitutes theory.=20

Good science always tries to DISPROVE hypothesis. Not prove it. Failure to =
DIS-prove it is what then=20
results in what becomes evolving theory. And still only theory at that.=20

It is thought that being close to a gravitational field has a biological ef=
fect on all matter including=20
cells. The effect is to slow the movement of electrons in the orbits of the=
ir nucleus which thus slows the=20
mechanical and bilological functions of the observer close to the gravity.=
=20

Thus the passing of time is a local phenomenon depending on how close you a=

This is one example of a theory involving "time shells" progressing in size=
 and intensity around a=20

Perhaps you would like to explain to me how your parents fully understand H=

How would your parents react to seeing you in 2000 as a 40 year old man? Th=

If you say the year 2005 is the war where 3 billion people die..you only ha=

"start a war"=20

So what your saying is that the development of the C204 is the reason the "=

So why are you trying to put us through your timeline and kill us too? Or a=

As Pamela said you have an obligation to this world line. We may be in infi=

that does not mean you should put us through your problems too.=20

What if you never showed up and gave us the skemtics? Are you trying to AVO=

There is a thin line between question and accusation. I'm pretty sure TT-0 =

abuse or accusal.=20

The reason this board is here is to determine the the plausabiliy and possi=

there is no such thing, or even the perception that there is no time travel=
 and no time travelers then we=20
need to unplug this board and for all of us to 'go home'.=20

The point is not is Mr. TT-0 for real but rather is what we THINK we are do=

All of the questions asked by Mr. Light have been answered in one way or an=
other. I believe Pamela has that=20
information if she has not released it already.=20

You assume I am here to start a war?=20

Consider this: You are a time traveler who wishes to go back in time to 194=
1 because your grandparents live=20
close to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. You realize you can't stop the war but you=
 may be able to help them=20
prepare for it. Strangely, December 7th comes and goes with no sneak attack=
. As the war in Europe rages=20
on, Japan fails to join the axis power, there is no war in the Pacific and =
the United States remains=20
neutral. Then, you watch as Germany begins to develop the atomic bomb... al=
l by themselves.=20

For a change, I have a question for all of you. I want you to think...think=
 very hard. What major disaster=20
was expected and prepared for in the last year and a half that never happen=
ed?=20

As far as war goes, I have faith you are quite capable of starting one all =
by yourself. I am hard pressed=20
to accept any criticism on my outlook on that subject. Growing up might hav=
e been a vastly different=20
experience for me than it was for most of you. Personal responsibility, det=
ermination, honor, friendship=20
and self-reliance are not just words we try to live up to or fantasize abou=
t. On my world line, life is=20

not easy. We live in a world recovering from years of war, poison, destruct=
ion and hate. All of it,=20

courtesy of the thinking and actions of people that live right now in the s=
ame world you do, worrying=20

about which stocks to buy or whether or not a stranger is lying to them on =
the internet. I believe that=20

hardship and challenge develop character and community. My first experience=
 with war came when I joined a=20
shotgun infantry unit at the age of thirteen. In the 4 years I served as a =
"rebel", I watched hundreds of=20
people get shot, burn and bleed to death. I know exactly where I was and ev=
ery detail of the exact moment=20
the first nuclear warheads began falling on Jacksonville. I know the pain a=
nd regret of not acting soon=20
enough to enjoy a relationship as a loved one dies of brain cancer from a w=
ar that gained nothing.=20

How can you possibly criticize me for any conflict that comes to you? I wat=
ch every day what you are doing=20
as a society. While you sit by and watch your Constitution being torn away =
from you, you willfully eat=20

I think you might be genuine is=20
that I have trouble thinking LIKE you do. I would expect this of an encount=
er with a "Chrono-alien".=20

It seems to me that there would be some effect from one parallel world to a=

The idea of many time lines I can 'get', but infinite ones? Perhaps on the =

awhile? Any light effects? or hazy misty shimmering distortion?=20

Time travel_0- The observation of time travelers "appearing" suddenly in a =
world line do not happen very=20
often. There are two cases and two points of view to consider. In the first=
 case, the time machine does=20
not move as it goes from one world line to another and then returns. The pe=
ople watching on the original=20
world linewould wave good bye and watch as the machine is turned on.=20

There would be a static discharge and the air would appear to "ripple" as i=
f it were getting denser. Then,=20
it would stop and the machine will have appeared to have gone no where. If =
the machine doesn't move its=20
position from world line to world line, the observer would not see it disap=
pear at all. In the second=20
case, if the machine is moved, it would disappear from the viewpoint of the=
 observer and return in a=20
different location based on where it was moved and turned on from the desti=
nation world line. In that=20
case, the rippling seems to dissolve the machine and it disappears. If that=
 happens while you are watching=20
it leave and you expect it to return, you know it was moved or had a seriou=
s malfunction. It is actually=20
quite dangerous to get too close to a distortion unit as it enters or leave=
s a world line. It vents=20
radiation and has a very strong localized gravity field. Personally, I worr=
y about that a great deal.=20

Pamela:2.What is the dimension of the field around the car? How many feet o=

Timetravel_0-lt can be adjusted to some degree. The CG (center of gravity) =
is adjustable within about 4=20
feet and the unit is effective about 10 to 12 feet in either direction from=

timetravel_0-Depending on weather or not you are going forward or backward,=
 the footprint of the unit is=20
different. I wouldn't quite say it "scoops" up the ground cleanly. It sort =
of vibrates it loose and takes=20
it along for the ride. It looks like someone raked the ground an inch or so=
 deep with a small hand hoe or=20
shovel. The negative ergosphere "scoops" up the front and back areas of the=
 field. The positive ergosphere=20

is average.=20

Timetravel_0-Not that I'm aware of. Its important that it remain as still a=

The fact that better equipment is supposed to get the reverse-time traveler=
 closer to their actual past=20
indicates that there is an ACTUAL SPECIFIC past that he is aiming for. So i=
f in practical application the=20
traveler ends up 2% divergent upon arrival in the past and if he stays in t=
hat line he finds that it is=20
not a line at all, but that going forward, divergence approches infinity. I=
f this is so, the only way to=20
get back to ones' original future is to have left some kind of specified ob=
ject or condition there as a=20
marker. Reverse time divergence is an artifact of the machine you use and n=
ot a built in natural law of=20

In this idea the past is exactly behind you and the future is always and li=
tterally "right around the=20

any parallel time lines=20
eventhough we may only ^realize* one line at once. Organic psyche may be wh=
at LIMITS divergence (of time=20

I tried to consolidate your questions into a basic list. I hope this helps.=
=20

1. Do not eat or use products from any animal that is fed and eats parts of=
its own dead.=20

2. Do not kiss or have intimate relations with anyone you do not know.=20

3. Learn basic sanitation and water purification.=20

4. Be comfortable around firearms. Learn to shoot and clean a gun.=20

5. Get a good first aid kit and learn to use it.=20

 contact with them.=20

7. Get a copy of the US Constitution and read it.=20

8. Eat less.=20

9. Get a bicycle and two sets of spare tires. Ride it 10 miles a week.=20

10. Consider what you would bring with you if you had to leave your home in=
 10 min. and never return.=20

(Can you tell us exactly what event started the war? Is there any way we ca=
n stop it?)=20

The war is a result of faulty politics and desparation from Western leaders=
hip during the US civil war.=20

Yes, I suppose you could stop it.=20

(Are some states or countries safer than others?)=20

s.=20

(Did they use biological and chemical weopons in the war besides nukes? Did=
 they use mind control weopons?)=20
Yes there were bio and chem weapons used. No mind control weapons but there=
 are new "non-leathal" weapon=20
systems that turn out to be quite leathal.=20

( Have you discovered the cure for cancer or aids yet?)=20

Aids...no. Cancer...some progress.=20

oyou say you are.what would=20

Revel in your confidence today because you will not win tomorrow.=20

(What is the main message you want to convey to us at this time?)=20

Please, please wake up. Look at the sign posts around you now.=20

(Can you explain this further when you talked of your patch and the two spi=
rals one was the "safe" way and=20
one was the way to God. Can you expound on that I didnt quite understand it=
.)=20

The safe way is the one calculated to take you in time where you want to go=

Perhaps it is better to understand if one understands that all fractional e=

 fractional entity in terms of=20

Thanks for the knowlege Pamela. I really think that the design or basic mod=
el that Time-o gave sounds legit=20
but I think that if he could replace the particle accelerator with a an ele=
ctromagnetic device that uses=20
only one kind of particle-a magnetic photon- that the energy would be much =
more stable and easier to=20
control. I also believe that such a replacement would require much less acc=
uracy and would be at the=20
minimum as efficient if not more efficient then the energy production that =
he is intent on using. A=20
gravity generator would also be just as affective in extracting the necessa=

device. This will require alot more effort such as discovering how to make =
a gravitational generator,=20

(What is the popular music like?)=20

Most of the same music you enjoy is available on archive. However the days =
of mega-stars playing multiple=20
track studio produced music and lip synching on a huge stage are pretty muc=
h isolated to your time period.=20
Like everything else, music is much less centralized. The general trend is =
away from "computer generated"=20
music and more toward real people playing real instruments. Music is much m=
ore of a personal experience.=20
More people know how to read music and play together in small groups.=20

(Are there any social prejudices)=20

Yes there are. However, as odd as it may sound, it serves a useful purpose =
in my time. First, you must=20
realize that your experiences with "prejudice" and mine are different. I wo=
uld characterize the=20
intolerance you have here as a result of ignorance and fear. I have observe=
d that people with unfounded=20
and irrational fears about their fellow man in this time have the luxury of=
 not having their beliefs=20
tested.=20

After the war, much of the prejudice you have now was swept away by simple =
necessity. People had to work=20
and fight together just to survive. This has a way of opening a person's ey=
es as to the value of fellow=20
human beings.=20

What difference does the color of a man's skin make when you are both fight=
ing against the same enemy to=20
survive or find water or grow food? On my world line, if a man doesn't pull=
 his weight in the community,=20
then we feel prejudice towards him as a burden to us. This feeling of shame=
 he experiences then makes him=20
realize his responsibilities.=20

(What is the health care system like)=20

You would probably not like it at all. I would compare it to what you see i=
n Western movies. We do have=20
hospitals but there are more family doctors and house calls as compared to =
what you are used to. There is=20
no real organized health care. If you get a serious disease, you die. This =
however has had a tendency to=20
strengthen the general genetic pool. Doctors are more concerned about thing=
s like broken legs, snake bites=20
and delivering healthy babies.=20

(What is the entertainment industry like, movies, tv, radio, internet?)=20

Again, entertainment is less centralized. There are "movies" and "tv" but e=
verything is distributed over=20
the net and more people produce their own "shows".=20

 you will always find work.=20

(If a group of people were to travel forward in time to avoid a situation, =
would they be still be able to=20
live in relative peace? Or would they be looked down on for that? Should th=
ey just keep that a secret to=20
make things easier?)=20

From a physical standpoint, I suppose that would work if you were trying to=
 escape a natural disaster. But=20
you must consider that trying to "escape" by time traveling has it's own pr=
oblems. I'm not exactly sure=20

(Also, a while back (page 2 of the posts) you said something was wrong with=
 UNIX in your time...what is wrong?)=20

Yes...and with your's too. I have to believe there must be a UNIX expert ou=
t there someplace that can confirm=20
that. I'm not exactly sure what the technical issue is but I believe some s=
ort of UNIX system registry=20

 have anything to do with the=20

Yes.=20

I'm not sure what power you are referring to.=20

(Tell me T-T_0, when you first typed a message here announcing your arrival=
...did anyone believe you?)=20

I don't know if anyone believes me now. But you must realize that I don't e=

Very highly technical, cooling stuff, [sorry, I don't get much of a chance =
to be a wise guy ]=20

(How much more advanced are the computer hardware and software systems in t=
he future? )=20

Good question! I would say the biggest difference is in the reliability of =
the hardware and software. It=20
absolutely amazes me how willing people are here to accept computer and sof=
tware failures on such a=20
regular basis. I was very surprised to see how prolific it is. You can look=
 forward to very stringent=20
manufacturing parameters and programming discipline. Think back to the earl=
y days of the computer and how=20
much work and cleverness it took to fit those programs into such small area=
s of memory. Has more and=20
cheaper memory brought better programs or just more programs?=20

greater then light even though existing in the present subluminal time fram=
e? inquisitively.)=20

Hmmm... I afraid my notebook on Maxwell's equations isn't with me and I mus=
t say again that I am not a=20

xist at all unless they are=20

Hello TT_0!=20

I have read some of the concourse up to the end of this topic's dialogue. I=
 find your answers to questions=20
posed, quite ... um, shall we say ... creative. To say the least you are a =
very imaginative person.=20

I am not here debunking your travels or to discount your stated technology,=
 but I do have just one=20
question.=20

1. If your machine is capable of traveling back through time from future ea=
rth to now, I wonder how your=20
vehicle landed on this earth at all? You obviously know that this earth and=
 your earth do not occupy the=20
same quadrant of space. Our earth is rotating along it's axis at 1600kph an=
d moving on an elliptical orbit=20
around a sun in a solar system which itself is circling and expanding the g=
alactic center of our galaxy=20
which is itself ever-expanding outward. In truth your machine should (but d=
oesn't) also have some kind of=20
'warp' capability incorporated in it in order to go back in space to the po=
int where we are now. It's a=20
wonder that your vehicle didn't end up in deep space or caught in the gravi=
ty well of some other stellar=20
mass. You would also need a life support system to sustain you until you we=
re within earth's atmosphere.=20

Oh, I know that you may claim to have access to galactic stellar cartograph=
y from this period of space and=20
time, but how would you account for the earth's rotational speed as well as=
 the moon's gravitation effect=20
and lastly the avoidance of man made structures which are not totally mappe=
d even by our geosynchronus=20
comsats of this day?=20

I'm not worried about pieces of dirt within your temporal field or even the=
 odd stray cat being dispersed=20
by your resulting static electricity, but I am curious as to how you overco=
me all of these obstacles from=20
the contoured seat of what you claim is just a time machine?=20

Pamela seemed concerned with the 'go nowhere ripple effect' that might occu=
r when a time machine left and=20
then returned, but I find even that logic flawed. I maintain that a time ma=
chine would imprint itself=20
spatially upon a certain time period. Einstein's Theory of Relativity would=
 dictate that even if you left=20
in such a machine for two minutes, this time would continue to advance and =
this world would still move=20
through space and rotate. Therefore a time machine would NOT appear to stan=
d still but rather would=20
(depending upon the time interval) appear to suddenly defy gravity as it di=
sappeared and then, free of the=20
gravitational momentum, would reappear in near or far space. If you think m=
y logic is faulty, then try=20

I will try to answer all of your questions however, I have noticed that the=
re seems to be a difficulty in=20
entering a conversation in the middle. Most of the following questions I ha=
ve answered at length in=20
previous posts. I understand how important it is to have these answers when=
 new people read portions of=20
the posting but I find it tiring to keep repeating myself. Any suggestions =
would be appreciated.=20

(I was just wondering who won the Super Bowl in the year 2001?)=20

I do not answer questions like this. Although I don't really know the motiv=
ation for the question...I can=20
guess. If a time traveler had knowledge of your future, and you could only =
ask one question, would this be=20
it? Besides, can you tell me if it rained in New York on June 4th 1932? You=
 are from their future so=20
should you know that?=20

(I have read some of the concourse up to the end of this topic's dialogue..=

This is actually a very good question that parts and pieces of the answer a=
re scattered around in previous=20
postings. I am often surprised that it is not the first one asked. You are =
correct, this problem is=20
actually the most difficult part of time travel. Although some of your assu=
mptions about matter=20
displacement are a bit off, the problem is real. Inside the displacement un=
it are a series of very=20
sensitive clocks and gravity sensors. This system is called the VGL (variab=
le gravity lock). In simple=20
terms, before the unit "leaves" a world line, it takes a base reading of th=
e local gravity and adjusts the=20
Tipler sinusoid to "lock" into that position. Although the tmporal physics =
of this statment are wrong, in=20
effect, it holds you to the "Earth". During travel, it periodically checks =
to see that the field has not=20
varied. If it does, it stops and reverses course or drops out at that point=
. Buildings and other terrain=20
features are avoided in the same way. Yes, we do bring oxygen in the vehicl=
e with us but we do not lose=20
atmospheric pressure.=20

(Pamela seemed concerned with the 'go nowhere ripple effect' that might occ=
ur when a time machine left and=20

I'm not sure what you mean by imprint?=20

(Einstein's Theory of Relativity would dictate that even if you left in suc=

Please see VGL system above. Also, please be aware that from the viewpoint =
of the time traveler, the=20

from an e-mail to timetraveler_0 and his answers. (TTO-If any of this is di=
fferent from what you sent me=20
please let me know.this is copied and pasted.)=20

1. what type of money system do you have on your world line? meaning how do=
 you buy and sell things? Do you=20
have the same type of money or do we have a cashless society? such as smart=
 cards, credit cards or ID=20
biochips.=20

Its not very different than it is now. Yes, we have money and credit cards.=
 However, like everything else,=20
the monetary system is decentralized. Banking is based mostly around the co=
mmunity structure. There are no=20
multinational banking or computerized economic systems. There are also no i=
ncome taxes.=20

2. do you still use radio transponders to ID your cattle and other farm ani=
mals?=20

Some of the larger farm communities use electronic markers and fences. I am=
 not a farmer so I don't have=20
very many details about that.=20

3.1s the Global Positioning Satellite system still in place around the Eart=
h?=20

Oh yes! In fact, the unit I have with me works here. I'm not sure why that =
surprises me. There are also a=20
great many communications and internet satellite systems.=20

4.Do you still have the American Flag as your flag? does it look different =
or is there a new flag?=20

Yes, we still have the flag. There is a debate about changing it from 50 st=
ars to 5.=20

5.1s there some states or areas that have new names ? is there a NewDenver,=
 Kansas by any chance?=20

Not that I can think of... No major cities anyway. I am aware that some sma=
ller towns changed their names=20
after the war and most universities have the word "fort" before them on my =
world line.=20

6. How many weeks of training is required before you timetravel? to what ex=
tent does the training involve?=20
Are you able to make basic emergency repairs to the unit?=20

I started training on the recommendation of my PS officer when I got out of=
 school in 34. I graduated in=20
March of 35. Actual hands on training started soon after that and I left 20=
36 in April. No, there are not=20
very many repairs I can make to the unit. The unit is built very well but t=
he tolerances are very small. I=20
could probably repair the electrical systems and it will accept inputs from=
 older computers.=20

7. Are you able to fish or are the waters polluted from fallout from the wa=
r?=20

Yes, we can fish. There are some areas that are still too dangerous to spen=
d a lot of time in so we can't=20
fish in those areas.=20

8. Are you aware of any time travelers from our time or other world lines t=
hat have entered your world line?=20
Have you spoke to any of them?=20

No I am not aware. But I accept the possibility.=20

9. What type of public transportation is used to get around in your cities?=
=20

A high speed train system connects the larger cities. Roads are still use f=
or cars and many people ride=20
horses and bikes.=20

10. What things do you think you will take back with you from this time?=20

Books! I'm also taking copies of family photos that were lost during the wa=
r.=20

11. How many weeks have you been in this world line? when did you arrive?=
=20

That I must keep to myself right now.=20

12. What kind of books do you like to read? What kind of music do you like?=
 do you play a musical=20
instrument?=20

I read a great deal of history. I like piano classics and some older rock a=
nd roll, (why did that type of=20
music go so far down hill?) No, I don't play any instruments myself.=20

13. Are you concerned about our government investigating you or trying to s=
eize you or your device?=20

Not really. In order to find me, they would have to believe time travel is =
possible.=20

14. are you videotaping or taking pictures of the events going on here to b=
ring back with you to your time?=20

Oh yes.=20

15. what is your favorite food to eat? here and in your world line.=20

Its very hard for me to find food here. It all scares the Hell out of me. I=
've found a couple of local=20
farms where I am resonably sure the raw food is safe and my mother started =
a garden for me.=20

16. does the cure for cancer have any thing to do with genetics?=20

Again...I'm no expert. I believe there is a great deal of progress in treat=
ing the cancer cells with modified=20
viruses. So I guess the answer is yes.=20

17. Do you have an increase in tornados and earthquakes than what we have n=
ow? is the average temperature in=20
Florida in your time about the same as it is here? or is it different?=20

That's one area I've decided not to talk about...sorry. The average tempera=
ture worldwide is a bit cooler.=20

18. are any of the other 7 time travelers with you in this world line or ar=
e you by yourself?=20

No. They are off doing something else I'm sure.=20

19. are there time travel web sites in the future? does this one still exis=
t?=20

Time travel is a major point of social discussion. I'll have to check when =
I get back. Most of the larger=20
servers that were in the major cities were lost or destroyed. I'll try to b=
ring a copy back with me.=20
Perhaps you can check that in your 2036.=20

20. do you feel any connection at all to your other 2 year old self on this=
 world line? does it seem like=20
you or someone totally different? who does he think you are when you talk t=
o him?=20

He calls me uncle. Yes, there is a connection. He fells like a younger brot=
her. Sometimes I get mixed=20

Well...it looks like the election is almost over. I have been quite busy in=
 the last few days and I=20

appreciate everyone's patience. I should be thanking you for listening and =
even if everything I have said=20
before means nothing, I expect it has at least been entertaining. I went th=
rough the postings looking for=20
questions I have not addressed yet. I hope I got to all of them. I get my e=
mail remotely through about=20
three different systems and I use one of your hand-held computer units to w=
rite with. In a few days, I=20
would like to send Pamela a list of questions of my own. As you know, one o=
f my areas of expertise is in=20
history and the information I have gathered has been invaluable. Although I=
 am not leaving right away, I=20
would like to include some of your thoughts in my report.=20

(Who's to say that someone that will read this board, will be the one to ac=
tually invent the means for the=20
C204 (or other units) to be operational? The divergence factor is so low, e=
verybody will forget about this=20
in a short time. I wouldn't worry about it When Timetravel_0 goes back, thi=
s will be nothing but a=20
memory...)=20

This statement is quite insightful. One of the reasons I have been communic=
ating this way is so that others=20
that do not post who I have directed here can see some of the information I=
 have shared with you.=20

(You speak of 1 &amp; 2 % "divergence" as being unimportant. I don't get it=
. Like for example if OUR IBM5100 is=20
1% different than the code you have to run on it, it ain't gonna work right=
. One percent in the FL vote=20
count would be important. If I could see only 99% of the cars on the road i=
t would be important to me. So,=20
what exactly is X% divergent, and why is it not a major problem?)=20

The divergence measurement refers to the local gravitational field as compa=
red to the point of origin. It=20
is mearly an empirical indicator of overall change in a world line. Some th=
ings that are quite different=20
on one world line have very little effect as time passes and the world line=
s appear to "converge" again=20
and look very similar. World line changes are not exponential, they act mor=
e like chaotic attractors with=20
varying effect depending on their size and location.=20

(Reading your posts I get conflicting ideas about what effect our timeline =
has on yours. Didn't you say=20
that "another you" was here now as a two year old child? Is the 'Everret Ma=
ny Worlds' interpretation of=20
quantum mechanics it the correct one then? You seem to look at us as repres=
entative of your ACTUAL=20
predecessors. There is something a bit unnerving about that. In fact the ma=
in reason why I think you might=20
be genuine is that I have trouble thinking LIKE you do. I would expect this=
 of an encounter with a=20
"Chrono-alien".)=20

You are correct in your thinking. This world line is not mine but it looks =
very similar. It may be compared=20
to reading two books that are the same. I can jump back and forth between t=
hem and still see the same=20
story. I do not consider you true representatives of my world line but I do=
 know something of how the=20
story ends. In consideration of Everret-Wheeler, the reason we don't know i=
f Schrodinger's cat is dead is=20
because it might have had a time machine.=20

(Russia has "ALWAYS" been considered the first Country, to be suspect of a =
probable Nuclear Attack against=20
the USA, and I, for one have NEVER relinquished the thought that inevitably=
, this will happen while I=20
remain alive to witness this unfortunate tragedy come to fruition.=20

You are also correct but I want to add a twist to your thinking. Russia's e=
nemy in the United States is not=20
you, the average person. Russia's enemy is the United States government.=20

(The fact that better equipment is supposed to get the reverse-time travele=
r closer to their actual past=20
indicates that there is an ACTUAL SPECIFIC past that he is aiming for. So i=
f in practical application the=20
traveler ends up 2% divergent upon arrival in the past and if he stays in t=
hat line he finds that it is=20
not a line at all, but that going forward, divergence approaches infinity.)=
=20

Yes, this is true. If I go forward on this world line, the future will not =
be my future. I get home by=20
going back to 1975 before I arrived and then going forward to 2036.=20

(Also if this theory is correct we may be 2% divergent from TT_0 but going =
forward in this time line he is=20
98% divergent from us. My logic is pretty good here, how's my facts?)=20

Your deductions are quite accurate. (I'm not stating yet that I did... but)=
 what if I told you I did go=20
forward to "your" 2036 and it looks nothing like mine. It is quite possible=

Real disruptions in world events begin with the destabilization of the West=

unrest develops near the next=20

 home schooling then there is=20
now. What are the class sizes like? Is there any emphasis on a subject or s=
ubjects that are don't exist=20
now?)=20

The education system has been through many changes. School in 2036 is no lo=
nger a political indoctrination=20
system and students "learn how to learn". Since community activity varies f=
rom place to place, the=20
emphasis on basic reading, math and language is augmented with skills parti=
cular to the community. One=20
school may emphasis farming while another teaches woodworking. Having child=
ren is a bit different and less=20
common in 2036. A typical school day involves a setting very much like it w=
as 100 years ago with smaller=20

To tell you the truth politics never really interested me that much...until=

Cholera is an acute bacterial infection of the small intestine.=20

The disease is caused by water and food that have been contaminated by fece=

causes watery diarrhea and depletes the body of fluids and minerals.=20

How to avoid getting it? There is currently a cholera vaccine available for=
 people traveling to areas where=20

Other preventive measures you could take would include drinking only boiled=

Some answers for TT_0:=20

1. According to the Constitution, who do you think has the final word on ch=
oosing a President and why?=20

I would say that the senate could use article 1 section 3 and appoint a pre=
sident pro tern, or they can use=20
the 20th amendment section 3. this could have been used in the recent case =
and a run off election could=20
have been done.=20

2. Do you think the Electoral College should be continued?=20

Yes, it can disagree with the popular vote. I thought the popular vote was =
more democratic.=20

3. Why do you think the Bill of Rights was written?=20

To preserve order and protect the people and to give them a sense of partic=
ipation in the formation of=20
policy in government.=20

4. What is your opinion of the second amendment to the Bill of Rights?=20

It seems as though I suffer from being myopic as well, the right to bear ar=
ms is all I ever heard. I think=20
it has been taken out of context as an excuse to have a gun and do anything=
 you want with it. I think=20
there should be some sort of responsibility amendment.=20

5. Does anyone know what industry is the largest US political contributor?=
=20

I thought it was the tobacco industry.=20

6. Does anyone know who owns the majority of the solar power research and d=
evelopment companies?=20

Other major power companies, P.G.+E, Con Edison. Dow Chemical also is in th=
ere.=20

7. Imagine you have all the money and power you desire. What do you see you=
rself doing?=20

Two things. Manufacturing electric cars - the right way. Research in my own=
 lab.=20

8. What is the longest distance you ever ran and/or walked at one time with=
out stopping?=20

Along time ago, 15 miles - a walk-a-thon for muscular dystrophy. More recen=
tly, 1 mile to and from work. I=20
like to see the stars in the early morning while going to work.=20

9. What is the longest period of time you went without food?=20

7 days, just to see if I could. 24 hours no water no food, 168 hours no sle=
ep. Not in that order and not=20
all at once=20

10. Do you know what Cholera is and how to avoid getting it?=20

Not sure on this one. I think it has something to do with un-purified water=
. You would need to boil the=20
water or add a purifying agent to it.=20

"Paradox", as an English word, has it's origins in Latin and Greek.=20

But alas, it is still just a word in any language, regardless of how it is =
spoken, ancient or modern. And=20
thus a verbal utterance that represents the conveyance of a concept. As all=
 words are.=20

Generally, it refers to the "idea" of the existence of a problem that has n=
o solution.=20

But again alas, this is nothing but an invention of the mind of man. Nothin=
g that actually occurs in the=20
Universe.=20

There are no paradoxes in the Universe.=20

The so called "grandfather" paradox has not, does not, and cannot ever occu=
r simply because the situation=20
that defines it is not possible in the first place. There is no past where/=
when your "grandfather" is=20
"alive" for you to ever encounter. Any more than there is a future where yo=
ur "grandson" travels back from=20
to encounter you.=20

If there is "Time Travel", it requires much more sophisticated concepts tha=
n this simple non-existant=20
"problem".=20

And...=20

The so called "twins" paradox is actually not a paradox at all once one und=
erstands the idiosyncrasies of=20
Relativity. Many think they do, but few actually do. Those who consider the=
 "twins" paradox to actually BE=20
a paradox, are among those who don't.=20

Hint: Think about what constitutes a "year", as opposed to watching the han=
ds of your wristwatch move.=20
Remember, "year" is again a word that conveys the concept of a single revol=
ution of the Earth around the=20
Sun.=20

Both "twins, the Earthbound one AND the travelling one will still have live=
d in a Universe where the Earth=20
went around the Sun the SAME number of times.=20

The traveler's BIOLOGICAL clock would run slower, as do physical clocks und=
er the circumstances, but the=20
Earth will have orbited the Sun the SAME number of times from BOTH of their=
 points of view! Even while the=20
traveler's watch ran slower.=20

Time dilation, as a proven effect of differing relative velocities may be a=
n unusual idiosyncracy inherent=20
in the properties of relativity, but...=20


50=20



There is no paradox here.=20

And it most certainly does not constitute Time travel in and of itself.=20

There is no paradox ANYWHERE in the Universe for that matter.=20

How could there be?=20

The very concept is itself absurd. A mind game. A modernist mythology. Righ=
t up there with Jupiter=20
governing the Universe from Mt. Olympus, or Noah's Ark.=20

You believe in the "Great Flood" perhaps. Gee, where did all the water come=
 from? (Descended from nowhere=20
out of space?) Where did it go? (Evaporated back into nothingness into spac=
e?) Do you have any idea how=20
much water it would take to cover the Earth up to the top of Mt. Everest an=
d beyond? Or how thick the=20
cloud cover would have to be that contained the water that constituted the =
rain that had to have fallen to=20

Very interesting argument but I have a couple of questions. You described t=
he word paradox as, "...it refers=20
to the "idea" of the existence of a problem that has no solution." Actually=
, the #1 definition I read in=20
the American Heritage Dictionary is "...a seemingly contradictory statement=
 that may nonetheless be true".=20

Also, what exactly is your definition of "time travel"? I was taught that t=
ime travel is strictly a local=20
observation that can only be measured by the experience of an individual or=
 single particle. Under that=20
definition, the "twin paradox" (time dilation due to acceleration or gravit=
y) and even sleeping can be=20
considered time travel. You appear to be arguing against dematerialization =
and/or spacelike trips under=20
the limits of special relativity in a single worldline.=20

I do agree that the "grandfather paradox" is not possible simply because th=
e classic problem is presented=20
as an observer's issue magnified to a universal issue. Your statements abou=
t observation are correct when=20
you isolate the experiences to a single worldline. However, the reason ther=
e are no paradoxes is because=20
the universe doesn't care how we react to its handy-work. In a Universe mad=
e up of infinite worldliness=20
(superuniverse), everything is possible and has a 100% probability, therefo=
re...no paradoxes.=20

"You believe in the "Great Flood" perhaps. Gee, where did all the water com=
e from?"=20

I believe the explanation for the "great flood" stories originate with the =
changes that occurred near the=20
Mediterranean at the end of the last ice age. Even on this worldline, there=
 is a great deal of evidence to=20
support the fact that sea levels did change radically in isolated areas wor=
ldwide. I also heard someplace=20
that if the ice mass on Antarctica melted today, sea level worldwide would =
rise about 100 feet. I'm not=20
exactly sure that's true but still... Mt. Everest might be a bit of a stret=
ch.=20

I do however agree with you that there are no physical paradoxes but for th=
e opposite reasoning.=20

Peace to you also.=20

Just because you cannot figuere out where the water came from for the Great=
 Flood is not a good enough=20
reason to conclude that it never took place.=20

In the ancient lore and legend of every culture you will find a story of a =
disasterous flood. These=20
accounts vary but in distant parts of the world these stories agree on one =
point, far back in history=20
there was a catacylmsmic flood which wiped out all but a handful of people.=
=20

From the indians of north and south america to the Islanders of the Pacific=
 and from the Chinese to atleast=20
40 aborigional races we find the elements of a great flood described.=20

Geologists of today all over the Earth find a layer of sediment which gives=
 evidence of a worldwide flood.=20

There are several different theories of where the water might have come fro=
m.=20

Here is the one I have heard:=20

The Earth had quite a different climate before and after the flood.=20

for in Geneisis 2:5-6 it states that the lord God had not caused it to rain=
 upon the earth...but there went=20
up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.=20

They argued that Genesis 1:6 described God seperating the waters on the ear=
th from the waters above the=20
Earth, which could describe a canopy of water vapor.Our Earth could have be=
en in effect a giant canopy=20
enclosed garden watered by gentle mists which came out of the ground from t=
he reservoirs of water below=20
the surface.=20

If the Earth before the flood had been surrounded by a canopy of water vapo=
r above the Troposphere it would=20
have compressed the air beneath and raised the average atmospheric pressure=
, just how much would depend on=20
how much water the canopy contained.=20

This increased pressure could have resulted in a greater oxidation rate, a =
much more efficient metabolism=20
and stronger, healthier people.=20

The sheilding of water vapor canopy could have eliminated almost all geneti=
c mutation from the harmful=20
solar radiation.=20

there would be benefits of living under increased atmospheric pressure. Dur=
ing the aquanaut program it was=20
discovered a cut on a aquanauts hand healed completely in 24 hours while su=
bmerged in a diving bell, back=20
then the current land mass was joined together in a hugh continent.=20

The Earth before the flood was a single land mass riding on a blanket of su=
perheated steam and with an=20
overhead curtain of water vapor protecting it from harmful solar rays.=20

After the flod the vapor canopy was gone the Earths climate was changed. At=
mospheric pressure dropped to=20
what it is today, without the water vapor canopy the Earth received more ra=
diation from the sun and=20
genetic mutations occured. mans lifespan was greatly reduced, and they obvi=
osly didnot live as long after=20
the flood. the other theory that goes with it sometimes is "the fountains o=
f the deep" were also let=20
lose.Gen 7:11 Which combined with the collapse of the water vapor canopy, p=
roduced a great amount of=20
water.the ripping apart of the crust would have triggered tsunamis of unpar=
alleled magnitude, sweeping the=20
Earth with walls of water from the existing oceans.=20

The initial rupture of the earths crust would have spewed a tremendous jet =
of super heated steam high above=20
the earths ionosphere, the vapor blanket resting on the air above the Earth=
 would have been overwhelmed by=20
the intensity and heat of this supersonic blast and would have collapsed as=
 sheets of worldwide rain.=20

The jet of water which gushed high above the earths atmosphere would have e=
ncountered frigid temperatures=20
converting the water almost instantly to ice crystals.=20

When the water vapor canopy which covered the Earth up to that point collap=
sed in rain, ending the green=20
house effect, the temperatures on earth would have been reduced to much the=
 same as they are today,=20
immediately after the flood, the ice crystals formed high above the earths =
stratosphere would have fallen,=20
dumping immense quantities of ice on the earths polar regions and northern =
latiitudes. This would explain=20
an enigma which has long perplexed the discovery of animals which had been =
quick frozen in Siberia and=20
alaska some still with undigested food in their stomaches and mouths.=20

there had to be an abrupt and extremely sudden change in temperature, from =
near tropical to extreme cold=20
within a matter of minutes.=20


52=20



I kept this in my mind, and a couple of years ago i saw an article in the n=
ewspaper where scientists had=20
found a couple miles long of watervapor in the upper atmosphere that was fo=
rming over a specific area and=20
they didnt know what it was doing up there. If i find the article i will po=
st it I did cut it out and save=20
it.=20

nobody knows for sure where the water came from and can only theorize but t=

Well ,I found the article but unfortunately I didnot cut out the date with =

VAPOR FLOWS FOUND IN THE ATMOSPHERE=20


WASHINGTON- Massive rivers of vapor, some carrying as much water as the Ama=
zon, have been discovered in the=20
lower atmosphere.=20

Reginald E. Newell, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said thur=
sday he was surprised to find=20
the flows while analyzing satellite data.=20

His findings are reported in Geophysical Research Letters, published by the=
 American Geophysical Union.=20

A half-dozen vapor rivers carry water from the equator toward the poles in =
relatively narrow streams,=20
Newell explained in a telephone interview.=20

"I expected to see things following air masses, which usually have much lar=
ger horizontal widths. The fact=20
that it's concentrated was a surprise to us. " said Newell. The flows "look=
 like a river," he said.=20

The newly discovered rivers do follow these general principles, but move th=
e moisture in narrow streams=20
rather than having it spread out over a large air mass.=20

They seem to generally trend toward the poles, Newell explained, though he =
has found a couple of cases in=20
which the stream encounters a typhoon,"gets entangled in itself and goes ba=
ck equatorwards."=20

The rivers also display waves in their movement, he said, though why this s=
hould occur is not clear.=20

The researchers calculated the length of some of these rivers of vapor at a=
s much as 4,800 miles with a=20
width of 420 to 480 miles.=20

What does this mean to the world's weather and climate? Newell and his asso=
ciates are trying to figure=20
that out.=20

"We haven't solved the relation between these rivers and fronts, highs and =
lows and the rest of the=20
synoptic (weather) pattern," Newell said.=20

that you don't want to answer any of his questions. You can't even do that =
instead you will ignore those=20
questions and write a lengthy reply to someone else just to get your point =
of view across. Well that is=20
what TT_0 is asking for. Why do you find so hard to answer him? It implies =
that you believe him more then=20

Timetravel_0:=20

I think we're probably closer than you think here. I'll certainly buy your =
explanation of time travel as=20
purely relative to the observer. I'm also not sure we're that far apart on =
the reason there are no=20
paradoxes. (Your Dictionary definition is of course the correct one, I was =
merely making a simplification=20
of it for my own purposes.)=20

As to the possibility of multiple universes, well, it gets used a lot to tr=
y to explain things that can't=20
be explained but to me it's a cop out due to lack of evidence and the very =
fact that it GETS used so much=20
as a way to explain that which is otherwise currently un-explainable. I nee=
d more evidence. The existence=20
of multiple universes leads me to believe that if there is more than one of=
 them, there must therefore be=20
an infinite number of them. If there are an infinite number of them, then e=
verything that can happen, has=20
already. I dislike this theory for two reasons. 1. It destroys the necessit=
y for free will thereby making=20
all descisions made by choice inherently moot. 2. It goes against "Occam's =
Razor". The principle that the=20

complicated as to require infinite universes just to solve the concept of p=
aradoxes.=20

Peace.=20

I thought it interesting that my little "Flood" analogy sparked such conver=
sation.=20

By all means many cultures refer to "Great Floods" in their history. And Lo=
cal phenomenea ARE the reason=20
these persist in mythology.=20

Pamela, you've been reading the propaganda of the "Young Earth Creationists=
" I see. Their web sites are all=20
over the place. Unfortunately, these theories they propound are not only NO=
T POSSIBLE, but have long since=20
proven to be so.=20

Unfortunately many of these, like the so-called "Dr." Kent Hovind have fabr=
icated their own "degrees" in=20
higher education. Hovind for instance, started a "University" in his living=
 room, awarded himself a=20
"Doctorate" in Theology, and uses this to tout his self professed "expertis=
e" in geological and biologocal=20
matters.=20

The "Vapor Cloud" myth is a fairly old one trotted out to answer the "Where=
 did the water come from?"=20
question. But YOUR explainations are right out of the Creationists handbook=
 101. And equally mythological=20
as they are without foundation or acceptance by the Scientific Community at=
 large.=20

Think about it. If it never rained before the flood, what did plants live o=
n? As to the Vapor Cloud it=20
self, it's already been calculated that to produce the water necessary for =
world wide full deluge, the=20
cloud would be so thick as to block out the sun entirely. Meaning it MUST h=
ave been dark always before the=20
so called "Great Flood". Preposterous. Every Creationists argument on this =
issue is totally debunk-able.=20
Not just because it isn't so, but because it can be PROVEN to be not so.=20

May I suggest you do some browsing around the various Talk Origins websites=
 where the real scientists hang=20
out and you'll begin to see how truly silly some of these Literal Scripture=
 interpretations really are.=20

Not that I'm arguing against (or for) the existence of God, just that if yo=
u want to view the Bible as an=20
informative and inspirational document, may I suggest that you at least stu=
dy the differences where=20
metaphor is used instead of an intended depiction of reality.=20

Genesis has TWO depictions or accounts of Creation. The Creationsts won't t=
ell you about the second one=20
because it is contradictory to THEIR view. And supports the concept of Evol=
ution. It's called selective=20
intepretation. And they engage in it all the time.=20

Sorry I have been out for a while. Does anyone no whether the forces exerte=

Mr. 0,=20

I just read your postings. Something did catch my eye. You mentioned that t=
he physics behind time travel=20
will be realized within the next year at CERN. Currently, the project being=
 run at CERN is the LEP, the=20
large electron positron collider. It was scheduled to be shut down this pas=
t November but was not due to=20
some potential evidence of a missing component of the Standard Model, the H=
iggs Boson. As you may or may=20
not know, the Higgs boson is the theorized mechanism by which particles acq=
uire mass. I will not mention=20
more of this but suffice it to say that I am aware that for an object to tr=
avel at the speed of light it=20
would have to be massless(that is to say if the photon is in fact a massles=

Hi Mr.0,=20

It is true that CERN has 4 detectors/experiments but they are all centered =
around the LEP experiment. There=20
are no experiments at CERN which deal with accelerating protons at this tim=
e. There is a planned=20
experiment in 2005, when the Large Hadron collider takes over the tunnel at=
 which the LEP is located. The=20
experiment you refer to is not at CERN it is at RHIC in Brookhaven National=
 Lab on Long Island, it is an=20
attempt to create a quark gluon plasma, a form of matter which would have b=
een present shortly after the=20
big bang but before condensation of quarks into particles like protons and =
neutrons.=20

I am aware of the possibility of using wormholes to time travel, however yo=
u are still unable to travel=20
back beyond the point of the creation of the wormhole. Even the Tipler cyli=
nder does not allow a traveller=20
to go back beyond the point at which the cylinder was made. It has been my =
view that in order to have=20
controlled time travel you would need to have a description of the quantum =
structure of space-time,=20
otherwise I do not see how you could undertake the calculations that would =
be needed. One reason it is not=20
certain that a wormhole could be used to travel through time is because it =
is believed that quantum=20
fluctations around the mouth of the wormhole would act to collapse it. Just=
 as in a similar fashion=20
quantum fluctations around the event horizon of a black hole act to make it=
 radiate particles and=20
eventually evaporate.=20

If you are a time traveller from 2036, how do you plan to retake your place=
 there. Your presence in this=20
time frame would, as you have pointed out, cause a "temporal divergence" fr=
om the natural sequence of=20
events. If you believe in the multiverse theory, may I ask you if you have =
memories of an unknown uncle=20
being around while you were young?=20

I fear our conversation is in danger of turning due to an effect that is qu=

Your points are all quite valid and I have discussed them at length on this=

linder is only a thought=20
experiment to explain the very real physics behind Kerr black holes. As to =
your other comments, again,=20
they are all true as defined by the limits of spacelike trips on single wor=
ldlines. It does not account=20
for travel between worldlines.=20

I have never claimed to be a physicist or an expert on what the CERN labora=
tory is doing at any given=20

"breakthroughs" they will or might have. My comments about the CERN lab are=

The major physics break through=20

 we haven't even touched on "Z"=20

THE world is on the brink of a new era that may resemble the script of a Ja=

international affairs are increasingly determined by large and powerful org=
anisations rather than=20
governments, according to a study just published by the CIA in Washington.=
=20

Click to enlarge=20

[Large graphic]=20

These could include alliances between some of the most powerful criminal gr=
oups such as the Mafia and=20
Chinese triads. Such groups, according to the CIA, "will corrupt leaders of=
 unstable, economically fragile=20
or failing states, insinuate themselves into troubled banks and businesses,=
 and co-operate with insurgent=20
political movements to control substantial geographic areas".=20


60=20






The agency adds: "Their income will come from narcotics trafficking; aliens=
 smuggling; trafficking in women=20
and children; smuggling toxic materials, hazardous wastes, illicit arms, mi=
litary technologies, and other=20
contraband; financial fraud; and racketeering."=20

The 70-page report. Global Trends 2015, will be required reading for the ne=
w president, George W Bush, and=20
his senior policy advisers. It suggests that the early years of the coming =
century are likely to be filled=20
with both potential and peril.=20

Compiled with help from think tanks in America and the International Instit=
ute for Strategic Studies in=20
London, the report projects a future in which globalisation, whether in the=
 shape of the European Union,=20
the International Monetary Fund, giant corporations or terrorist gangs, pla=
ys an increasing part in the=20
lives of ordinary people.=20

"Governments will have less and less control over flows of information, tec=
hnology, diseases, migrants,=20
arms, and financial transactions, whether licit or illicit," it concludes.=
=20

In addition to confronting the growing economic and military power of China=
 and India and the continuing=20
decline of Russia, the CIA says: "Between now and 2015 terrorist tactics wi=
ll become increasingly=20
sophisticated and designed to achieve mass casualties."=20

In particular it notes the growing threat of biological and chemical weapon=
s and "suitcase" nuclear devices=20
against the United States. In addition, it expects rogue states such as Ira=
q and Iran to develop long=20
range missiles in the near future.=20

Iran, it says, could be testing such weapons by as early as the coming year=
, and cruise missiles by 2004.=20
Iraq could have missiles capable of hitting America by 2015, with both nati=
ons developing nuclear,=20
chemical and biological warheads.=20

Potential flashpoints have a familiar ring and include India and Pakistan, =
China's relations with Taiwan,=20
and the Middle East, where the best that can be hoped for is a "cold peace"=
.=20

Elsewhere, the world population will grow by more than one billion, to 7.2 =
billion, most of the increase=20
coming in the mega-cities of the developing world. In Europe and Japan, an =
ageing population and static=20
birthrate means that allowing more immigration may be the only way of meeti=
ng a chronic shortage of=20
workers.=20

The gloomiest predictions are reserved for Africa, where Aids, famine, and =
continuing economic and=20
political turmoil means that populations in many countries will actually fa=
ll. At least three billion=20
people will live in regions where water is in increasingly short supply.=20

On the other hand, there is good news on energy supplies. "Energy resources=
 will be sufficient to meet=20
demand," the study says. The CIA report is most optimistic on the world eco=
nomy, which it says has a=20
potential for growth not seen since the 1960s. Computer technology represen=
ts "the most significant global=20
transformation since the Industrial Revolution".=20

"At the same time, genetically modified crops will offer the potential to i=
mprove nutrition among the=20
world's one billion malnourished people. China's economy will grow to overt=
ake Europe as the world's=20
second largest but still behind the United States. Russia's economy will co=
ntract to barely a fifth of=20
America's.=20

The study expects the European Union to narrow the economic gap with Americ=
a. It points out, however, that=20
"lingering labour market rigidity and state regulation" mean that "Europe w=
ill not achieve fully the=20
dreams of parity with the US as a shaper of the global economic system".=20

The 2015 report is an update of a 1997 CIA study into the world in 2010, wh=
ich it admits failed to=20
anticipate the global economic crisis that occurred between 1997 and 1998 w=
hich had the hardest impact in=20
the Far East and Russia.=20

The new survey suggests a number of alternative scenarios, none of which ma=
kes happy reading. These include=20
a trade war between Europe and America, and an alliance between terrorist o=
rganisations to attack the=20
West. Most alarming of all, it raises the possibility of economic stagnatio=
n, followed by America=20
abdicating its role as the world's policeman.=20

At the same time tensions begin to grow in the Far East, where China orders=
 Japan to dismantle its nuclear=20
programme, leaving, the report says, no alternative but for "US re-engageme=
nt in Asia under adverse=20
circumstances at the brink of a major war".=20

jumpsuits clamber over the high bay, down metal steps, and retreat to a cop=
per-coated room behind a foot=20
of cement.=20

Another switch is flipped, another mouse clicked. To the piercing sound of =
an alarm, a countdown in the=20
Marx generators ensues, or rather a count up, in kilovolts, comes in a mono=
tone, almost hollow voice=20
beneath the frantic alarm. The man in the control room on a tinny loudspeak=
er, the Machine speaking=20
through the human.=20

'Twenty kV=E2=80=9E.'=20

'Thirty kV...'=20

'Forty kV...'=20

At 90, the floodgates open: a pulse of electricity surges out of the Marx g=
enerators toward an inside ring=20
of giant capacitors and then through a series of gas switches. The current =
is compressed by the Machine=20
into a wild whitewater of electricity that charges toward the vacuum chambe=
r at a speed of 60 million feet=20
per second. On its way, it passes through painted sharks' mouths, drawn the=
re by the men in white and blue=20
jumpsuits in the way that fighter pilots sometimes draw on their warplanes =
to show their prowess - or hide=20
their misgivings. The electricity pours past the sharks' mouths, is redirec=
ted downward, along the Z axis,=20
into the vacuum chamber, blitzing and bombarding from all sides a three-dim=
ensional target in a gold-=20
plated can, a delicately strung array of tungsten wires the size of a spool=
 of thread, hanging in black=20
space like a tiny chandelier.=20

Driven so furiously in the Machine, and then storming the array, the pulse =
of electricity - enough juice=20
now to light up America like a birthday cake - instantly vapourises the tun=
gsten wire into plasma, a=20
superheated ion gas. The ions hover and dance along the invisible circumfer=
ence once described by the=20
array, while a relentless magnetic field keeps pressing on them, shoving th=
em from behind. Thrusting and=20
squeezing and ramming until the ions can no longer resist, the centre canno=
t hold, and in that hot=20
nanosecond - Boom ! Everything becomes one.=20

This is not a gentle conjunction but a Pandora's box suddenly ripped open b=
y nuclear passion, an orgy of=20
ions. Boom ! Lightning fills the Machine, veins out over the surface of the=
 water. Temperatures flare to=20
those inside the sun. The earth rocks once again. And in few billionths of =
a second, 290 terawatts - 80=20
times the power generated on earth at any given time - roar to life inside =
the Machine.=20

Watching it through a Plexiglas window, you might as well be watching the b=
eginning of the universe. Or the=20
end of it. Contained in that single flash of white light, when the Machine =
holds the heat and the power of=20
the sun, when the room fills with lightning, there is everything we know - =
and everything we may become.=20
The 21st century. A world covered by rooms of little suns, generating inten=
se energy and, with it, the=20
possibilities of time travel and galaxy hopping. Peace among nations. Or th=
e end of time as we know it, a=20
hole ripped in the universe by the Machine, something many doomsayers predi=
ct, and the earth sucked into=20
oblivion. Our downfall or salvation. A fusion machine they call Z.=20

The magic bean; the Holy Grail: fusion. The idea is to take two isotopes of=
 the hydrogen atom - deuterium=20
and tritium - and mash them together with a little energy, which in turn re=
leases enormous amounts of=20
energy in the form of a single neutron. Contrarily, fission, the method wid=
ely employed by today's nuclear=20
reactors, splits heavy uranium and plutonium atoms, creating lots of energy=
 but also tons of dangerous and=20
everlasting radioactive waste. Fusion offers a clean source, borne out of t=
he material of roughly a=20
handful of water and a handful of earth, with its only by-product being an =
easily disposable helium-4=20
nucleus.=20


62=20





What would fusion mean? Endless, cheap energy. Amazing Star Trek , space-tr=
avel possibilities. Fame,=20

fortune, and undoubtedly a Nobel or two for the lucky scientists. For the b=
etter part of five decades, the=20
race has two separate approaches: magnetic confinement and inertial confine=
ment. Most researchers - those=20
from Japan, Russia, Europe and America - focus on the former: big accelerat=
ors called stellarators,=20
spheromaks, and tokamaks (a machine designed partly by Andrei Sakharov) use=
 huge magnets to contain and=20
compress hydrogen isotopes that hover in a kind of reddish-blue plasma insi=
de the huge torus-shaped tubes=20
until implosion.=20

On the other hand, the idea behind inertial confinement is that tiny fuel p=
ellets of deuterium and tritium=20
are bombarded by lasers or X-rays. In the case of the Z Machine, the explos=
ion that occurs when ions are=20
released by the vapourised wire array, and then when ions are pinched toget=
her, creates a huge X-ray=20
pulse, one that scientists hope can be used to heat the tiny pellets and, i=
n turn, create a small=20
thermonuclear explosion. As it is, fusion has never been achieved for an ex=
tended time outside the=20
explosion of a hydrogen bomb.=20

The first time scientists attempted to shoot an early incarnation of the Z =
machine, in June 1980, there was=20
bravado and false bravado and downright fear. At Sandia National Laboratori=
es on Kirtland Air Force Base,=20
in the same New Mexican high-desert landscape of America's greatest, most f=
rightening nuclear discoveries,=20
they'd been working on the Machine for four years. Yet there were still unk=
nown variables, a scientist's=20
nightmare. First, it was so much bigger and more powerful than any of its p=
redecessors. What if the Marx=20
generators blew up before it could be shot? What if residual X-ray radiatio=
n contaminated people in the=20
area? Or a fire destroyed the complex? And what if everything worked perfec=
tly and they got a huge energy=20
release that blew up Albuquerque itself? It was a scenario that had been co=
nsidered at the highest level.=20
As had something worse: what if people later wished that it had been only A=
lbuquerque that blew up?=20

The shot - Sandia shorthand for the firing of the Machine - was scheduled f=
or a Friday night. But then the=20
machine blew a fitting. The technical crew - the frogmen, as well as the me=
n in white and blue jumpsuits -=20
worked feverishly, and by Saturday noon the Machine was ready again. 'No on=
e knew what to expect,'=20
remembers Gerry Yonas, 58, an engineer and physicist and one of the foundin=
g fathers of the Z Machine.=20

They took all necessary precautions, charged the Marx generators, and cross=
ed their fingers. A switch was=20
flipped, electricity pulsated into the Machine, ripped through the switches=
, stormed on to the wires.=20

There was a wicked jolt, and... silence. Sweet, beautiful silence. Everyone=
 was still on earth; everything=20
seemed to work. The feeling was surreal. 'I felt the ground shake,' says Yo=
nas, grinning at the memory,=20
'and everybody said: "Let's do it again!" Nobody wanted to go home. I had t=
o kick them out. There was=20
nowhere else in the world to be. This was the beginning.'=20

The scientists, at that time a group of 20 or so men, threw high fives and =
drank beer. Pure, silly=20

jubilation. Only later, photographs of what actually had occurred inside th=
e Machine made them gasp: huge=20
dragon snorts of fire filled the hangar. Apparently, plumes of oil had spra=
yed skyward in the instant of=20
explosion, flamed, and then flamed out before the men returned inside the M=
achine. They had nearly blown=20
themselves up. By the grace of some benevolent god, or the Machine itself, =
they were allowed to return to=20
work on Monday morning, giddy limbs intact.=20

Over the next 15 years, the Z Machine gradually improved its output, packin=
g an astonishing wallop - 20=20

trillion watts' worth of electrical output, as compared with the mea gre 10=
0,000 amps of the first machine=20

- but it wasn't enough. Scientists and theoreticians estimated that for hig=
h-yield fusion to be achieved=20
inside the Machine, it would need to generate something over 1,000 trillion=
 watts. A factor of at least 50=20
of Z's output.=20

Which is when the men in suits and ties tried to kill the Machine. It was a=
 dinosaur, they argued, no=20

longer useful. They felt Z-pinch technology could not yield the mother lode=
. By 1995, even Yonas, who was=20
about to become a grandfather, was acutely feeling the passage of time. He =
sadly had to admit that maybe=20
he should sacrifice Z and all the optimism that had driven the project. Per=
haps achieving high-yield=20
fusion, something scientists compare to the invention of the lightbulb for =
its potential to change the=20
world, did indeed belong to the other fusion machines, the stellarators and=
 spheromaks and tokamaks. To=20
the Russians or the Japanese or the British or the confederate nerds at Pri=
nceton or Lawrence Livermore or=20
Oak Ridge. And maybe Sandia National Laboratories - over time, a place know=
n more for its secretive=20
mystique, its downright weird nefariousness, dating to the cloak-and-dagger=
 days of Little Boy and Fat Man=20

- would have to sit on the sidelines while someone else gave the world perh=
aps its greatest legacy.=20

But a funny thing happened on the way to the chop shop. Maybe it was llth-h=
our desperation, or some=20

invisible bolt of providence visited on a few overworked scientists, a coup=
le of whom lit on the simple=20
idea of stringing the wire array, the spool-sized target at the centre of t=
he Machine, with double, then=20
triple, the tungsten wire. All of a sudden - Boom ! Forty trillion watts! N=
o one believed it. They=20
reconfigured the Machine, boosting its X-ray production. Then someone, Meli=
ssa Douglas, thought to stack=20
the arrays. Boom ! Two hundred trillion watts in a single pulse! Short of a=
 nuclear blast, it was the most=20

energy ever released on earth, and suddenly, in 1998, after five decades of=
 chasing the illusion of high-=20

yield fusion, of regarding it as some far-off Atlantis or dark galaxy's edg=
e, the Z Machine was a third of=20
the way there.=20

In science, if you do something once that's never been done before, it's co=
nsidered a mistake. Do it twice,=20
and it's simply a mirage. But the third time it becomes the truth. With Z's=
 new, seemingly impossible=20
results came the first flickering sign that some deep, unknowable power res=
ided in the Machine. And so=20
today, the Z Machine is considered one of the world's best hopes for achiev=
ing fusion. 'We may not=20
understand how we get these huge pulses of power, the meaning may still elu=
de us,' says Yonas. 'But it's=20
still a fact.'=20

One that Yonas himself, at first, had a hard time grasping. After he was ha=
nded the results, he remembers=20
squinting at them, and sitting back at his desk as if blown by a solar wind=
. 'My God, ' he said in a small=20

voice. 'This could work. This could really work.'=20

Listen to the Z scientists, to their best idea ('The use of stark-shifted e=
missions to measure electric-=20
field fluctuations and acceleration gaps'), and their dream ('To remedy pla=
smic instability and create=20
higher temp- eratures'), and you enter a kind of friend country that become=
s an Andean prison from which=20
it gets harder and harder to escape. The scientists admit that, at moments,=
 their whole selves are=20
inseparable from the Machine, that the pull of the Machine is so great that=
 re-entering normal life can be=20
nearly impossible.=20


63=20


Jim Bailey, a handsome, soft-spoken, loafer-wearing plasma physicist whose =
conversation is peppered with=20
references to spectroscopy and 'the visible regime', says sometimes it's ev=
en hard to go to a neighbour's=20
barbecue - can't make small talk, can't communicate what you do - let alone=
 talk to your wife. Mark=20
Derzon, a boyish, bearded nuclear physicist, says he works a system with hi=
s wife: when he walks through=20
the door at the end of a day, he says green light ('Yes, everything is fine=
, I'm ready for the kids');=20
yellow light ('Give me 15 to decompress'); or red light ('I need time'). Me=
lissa Douglas says that there's=20
no line drawn at all between the Machine and her private life - that the Ma=
chine, her place inside of the=20
Machine, studying something called Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, is her pr=
ivate life. And now, at the age=20
of 36, she's watched her friends get married, have families, settle, and on=
 occasion she's wondered to=20
herself: 'what am I doing? Can we really make fusion work?'=20

Since the 1950s, the US government has invested nearly $15bn to find out, a=
lways with the promise that=20
fusion is just around the corner - two, three, five years away - and, with =
it, a fusion revolution that=20
would hurtle us to the centre of the earth, the deepest trenches of the oce=
an, and the farthest reaches of=20
space. A revolution that would morph the Third World into the First World u=
ntil we are simply One World.=20

After all, how many wars have been fought over oil? And then, with oil rese=
rves expected to reach full=20

depletion by 2050, how many more will be? Remove oil as a vital component o=
f our speed-driven, chip-fitted=20
age and, sure, people would find things to brawl over, but energy wouldn't =
be one of them.=20

And with limitless, cheap energy, the development of poorer nations wouldn'=
t be one of them, either.=20

And with development, the have-nots and pariahs of the world would theoreti=
cally join the haves, and so=20
food and housing and education wouldn't be one of them.=20

And with a higher standard of living would come a new freedom for humanity.=
 For at its heart, fusion, as a=20
Utopian ideal, has always symbolised freedom; freedom from the mistakes and=
 waste of our past, the Hanford=20
Reservations and the Savannah River Sites - those vast, spooky, radiating u=
nderground storage facilities=20
chambered with containers of plutonium and iodine waste, on top of which Am=
erica is built. Though left=20
unsaid, the race for fusion has always been about democracy or a democratic=
 alternative.=20

And yet one of the biggest threats to fusion comes from the same group of p=
eople responsible for the=20
Hanford Reservations and the Savannah River Sites: the US Government. Recen=
tly, Congress and various=20
federal agencies have become disenchanted by the fusion dream. Critics have=
 lambasted it as a waste of=20
time and money. If we haven't achieved it in the last 45 years, they argue,=
 we never will. The US has=20
dropped out of a proposed $10bn international fusion project called ITER, l=
eaving the facility in doubt of=20
completion. Meanwhile, the government has spent $3bn, with as much as an ad=
ditional $43bn to come, on=20
developing Nevada's Yucca Mountain as a vast nuclear-waste site - despite w=
ell-documented problems - and=20
continues its commitment to fission reactors despite the fact that radioact=
ive waste can be lethal up to=20
600 millennia after burial. Leaders in fusion field, like the Princeton Pla=
sma Physics Laboratory, have=20
mothballed their big machines, laid off staff, and now are fighting simply =
for their own survival.=20

'You have to find a way to justify doing something that you may never see a=
ccomplished in your lifetime,'=20
says Jim Bailey, who has a penchant for reading Hume. 'I mean, instead I co=
uld be working for a cancer=20
cure, with at least a greater hope of finding one. But I'm OK with this. I'=
ve made my peace with it.=20

Fusion will be the greatest scientific achievement of our time.'=20

Yonas, with the Super Bowl confidence of Joe Namath, predicts that usable h=
igh-yield fusion will be made=20
available to the American public by an accelerator called X-l, a generation=
 or two beyond Z, within three=20
decades - maybe sooner. Mark Derzon, a member of what's called the Advanced=
 Concepts Group at Z, has=20
designed what would be the first practical Z-pinch reactor - 'A zero-miracl=
e power plant,' he cheerfully=20
proclaims, and believes that the Z technology is rougher and tougher, able =
to sustain more of the constant=20
rock and roll of such a plant, than are the sensitive lasers and vacuums ne=
cessary for magnetic=20
confinement. But optimism usually carries the day only past lunch; the requ=
est to draw up preliminary=20
plans for X-l, with its price tag of up to $lbn dollars, is likely to be ap=
proved by the Department of=20
Energy.=20

'Every day, it's a leap of faith,' says Neal Singer, a science writer at Sa=
ndia. 'Adding wires to the array=20
- where did that idea come from? From the outside it makes no sense. It's i=
ncredibly complex and difficult=20
to string tungsten wires l/10th the diameter of a piece of hair and space t=
hem perfectly. And they did it=20
and got tremendous results. Then they added more and more, spaced them a li=
ttle differently and now we're=20
a third of the way there. It takes these little steps, this day-by-day thin=
king. Hour after hour. Ten, 12,=20
14 hours a day. The constant question is. Can you just make a little change=
 to influence the result?'=20

Thus the world inside the Machine is driven down to its smallest, most madd=
ening detail. For in the end,=20
fusion - its possibility and reality, its attainment and capture - comes ou=
t of this finely tuned call-=20
and-response with the universe itself, the channelling of some great unknow=
n, copulating force that calls=20
for the perfect alignment of human and Machine. That is, the human culture =
surrounding the Machine=20
attempts to mimic the Machine itself , which is trying to mimic the univers=
e. The mannerisms of the=20
Machine become the mannerisms of its minions - people rage and tyrannise, o=
verheat, relent, synergise,=20
procreate, vanish, and recur. One idea seems brilliant and fails, while ano=
ther may start as a quail but=20
then, compressed by other ideas - electrons stripping off, ions colliding -=
 transforms into something=20
sharp and fast, something agitatingly, beautifully right. And then, of cour=
se, it is shot into the Machine=20
to see if it is.=20

Still there is Melissa Douglas's nagging doubt, which is the nagging doubt =
of everyone here. On certain=20
days, it is possible to believe that you are merely trapped in the rubble o=
f some cosmic joke with no=20
punch line, that Godot is eating chilli dogs somewhere and won't be able to=
 make it. After all, Jim=20
Bailey's lab books are full of 13 years' worth of jottings; Mark Derzon has=
 pulled countless all-nighters=20
in the name of what may or may not be the reactor of the future; Melissa Do=
uglas has spent entire months=20
of her life obsessing over a single equation, the pallor of her face reflec=
ting only pale computer light -=20
all of this thought and activity and faith belying the possibility that the=
ir efforts might be for=20
nothing. And yet as much as the race for fusion is a race against the Russi=
ans at Triniti labs, or the=20
Germans at FZK labs, or other American scientists at Lawrence Livermore, it=
's also literally a race=20
against the ticking internal clocks of each scientist who entertains the qu=
estion: will I live to see it?=20

'History forgets the individual,' says Mark Derzon pensively, surrounded by=
 no fewer than 30 photographs of=20
his young daughters. 'One day Plato will be forgotten. Ultimately, the name=
 you make for yourself is not=20
the important thing. It's what you did, what you stood up for, what you act=
ed on. Did you try to make the=20
world a better place? In order to do it, the world needs fusion. I just hap=
pen to think that Z is the best=20
way to get there. And we're going to have one serious pizza party around he=
re if it is.'=20


64=20


Jimmy Potter stands inside the Machine, glaring down into the half-million-=
gallon pool of water at the=20
submerged refrigerator-sized capacitors where, he suspects, there may be a =
broken, bubbling gas switch.=20
Potter, a Texan, is the keeper of the Beast, the man who oversees the whole=
 shebang for today's shot. 'Are=20
those bubbles down there?' he asks out loud, vexed. 'We already sent the di=
vers in. I sure hope not.'=20

If Potter is driven by perfection, then he is merely a reflection of the cu=
lture at Sandia National=20
Laboratories. And if the quest for fusion is intensely competitive, Moonily=
 quixotic, and at times=20
downright nasty, then Sandia mirrors, among its myriad projects, many of th=
ose same contradictory=20
characteristics. Top secret or otherwise, spread over the dusty 27-square-m=
ile patch of Kirtland Airforce=20
Base, the projects include the training of honeybees to detect land mines, =
the invention of a foam that=20
kills anthrax, the making of a synthetic sludge, and the perfecting of vari=
ous micromachines, some so=20
small as to be undetectable by the human eye, which might be used to lock d=
own nuclear weapons. Sandia is=20

the home to Teraflops, the fastest computer in the world, as well as the bi=
rthplace of moly-99, a=20

radioactive substance widely used in medical procedures. On the east of the=
 base, behind three rows of=20
concertina wire, is a cluster of foothills rumoured to be now-empty nuclear=
 silos. They seem to stand as a=20

reminder of how closely the isotopes of Thanatos and Eros can be held in th=
e same idea, for it to be a=20

real idea, a saving idea, both have to be there, threatening to undo us and=
 remake us at once. To=20
obliterate and immortalise.=20

Potter couldn't care about all that. 'My job is to work with the personalit=
ies here,' he says, now pacing=20
the high bay, twitching with pent-up energy. He slips behind a pig (a radia=
tion shield), and checks a=20
silver box that houses a cryogenic pump. He monitors the tech crew, confers=
 with the lead scientist on the=20
shot, keeps everything running on time. 'You've got your top of the Ivy Lea=
gue class,' he continues.=20
'You've got prima donnas with huge egos. And you've got technicians who at =
least graduated high school.=20
Nobody can operate without the other. The first thing that happens with two=
 strong personalities is clash.=20
It's my job to go to one and bring him up and maybe bring the other one dow=
n and then bring them=20
together.'=20

Of course, there are days when everything feels charged with Shakespearean =
plots and counterplots, days=20
when tension fills up around the Machine. All of it is caused by the Machin=
e, which rarely exists, of=20
course, in its aluminum-and-Rexolite grandeur, oblivious. There is head-but=
ting between the young comers=20
kicking with ideas and the upper echelon of Z veterans, who ultimately hold=
 the power here. There are=20
Iagos trying to ice someone else's idea in order to promote their own. (The=
 lab rewards the best with=20
bonuses.)=20

'I've become a lot more aggressive,' says Melissa Douglas, one of only thre=
e women among the 60 full-time=20
scientists who work on Z. 'You have to really stand your ground. It was ver=
y hard for me to do that at=20
first.' In four years on the project, she remembers her worst day as the on=
e when she delivered a seminar=20
and a colleague heckled her mercilessly. Why? Was she that stupid? Did her =
PhD in plasma physics and her=20
postdoc at Los Alamos make her that inept? So she took her weakness, her in=
security, her lack, and shot it=20
into the Machine, and it came back as power, 290 terawatts' worth.=20

As have others. Marriage is shot in. Love is shot in. Innocence and experie=
nce and numbers are shot in, and=20
come back as something almost holy.=20

While many of these scientists consider themselves agnostic, they are quick=
 to admit that they still find=20
themselves in thrall to the unknown, to the force that pulses through the M=
achine. 'In a deep sense, I=20
would say that my greatest satisfaction here comes from the act of creation=
,' says Jim Bailey. 'Because=20
what we're trying to do is create knowledge that didn't exist before. Wheth=
er that brings us closer to God=20
or not, I don't know. It brings us closer to an understanding of the univer=
se, and if you want to think of=20

God in those terms, then I suppose you could define it that way.'=20

Melissa Douglas describes the charge of joy she gets from a perfect photogr=
aph of a Rayleigh-Taylor=20
instability taken inside the vacuum chamber by a pinhole camera at the mome=
nt of the wire array's=20
implosion. 'A beautiful picture!' she says, holding up a snapshot that look=
s more like a Rorschach test -=20
kind of blobby with spikes and valleys. 'It sounds ridiculous, but when I f=
irst saw it I jumped and hopped=20
around the room. Ecstatic. Just amazing. Being around this machine, you can=
't help but feel awe. The=20
universe is mathematical and, you know, God is a mathematician.'=20

And Jimmy Potter - Jimmy Potter is clearing the high bay as sirens sound fo=
r all personnel to vacate the=20
Machine and retreat to the control room. Today's shot will attempt to find =
a way to bombard the wire array=20
uniformly with electricity, so that each last kilovolt of energy can be acc=
elerated into the Machine and=20
come back as more. 'I mean, how do you explain all this to someone outside =
of this place?' he says,=20
gesturing toward the Machine. 'We don't make a product that can be sold. Yo=
u can't really see what's going=20

on on in that vacuum chamber. I usually just tell people I work with X-rays=
. That we've got a big machine=20

doing big things, and one day we're gonna change your life.'=20

Dawn inside the Machine, and it's silent. The frogmen and the men in white =
and blue jumpsuits are arriving,=20
shaking off their sleep, downing coffee. Jimmy Potter got the shot last nig=
ht, downloaded the diagnostics,=20
sent everyone home saying they'd take apart the Machine today, and then dro=
ve the half hour to his house,=20
over the mesa and the beautiful landscape, to his wife and kids, trying to =
forget this place for a few=20
hours. At 5.30am, he was back, rallying the crew, which now has sluggishly =
begun its work, drilling and=20
hammering at the vacuum chamber.=20

The people of Z admit there's a new inten sity, especially given the Machin=
e's recent exponential gains.=20

Dear Mr Deviper,=20

Interesting indeed I will look up the points you stated for they are quite =
compelling. I do admit that the=20
information I recieved came second hand so I trully cannot vouch for the ac=
curacy of the statements in the=20
story and I appologize to the people on the forum for the confusion. My fat=
her once told me that there are=20
two topics that can never be agreed upon...religion and politics. However I=
 do hold to my beliefs but=20
without having performed carbon dating or other methods myself I cannot tes=
tify for or against their=20
legitimacy. Is there any documented proof of a positive recorded in any lab=
? If do you have access to this=20
proof that you may back your claims that creation is completely proven wron=
g as you so subtely implored in=20
the last two paragraphs? Can you explain to me how it is more logical for s=
uch an intelligent existance to=20
acurr merely by trillions of chance happenings whose probabillity of actual=
ly acurring is practically=20
imeasurable then for an infinitely intelligent creator to have planned the =
creation. Do the numbers it is=20
far more logical and probable for the universe to have been created then ju=
st to have acurred. By the way=20
infinity has to exist. For infinity not to exist is a violation of thermal =
dynamics in that something=20
cannot come from nothing. So if every chance happening accurs from a "big b=
ang" before which nothing=20
existed then something came from nothing. No this is not disputed by religi=
on but by scientific law. Tell=20
me how to get around this one. Let us first try to analyse order and chaos.=
 In an infinite period of time=20

does a universe with a mixture of order and chaos degrade to pure chaos res=
ulting in a constant state of=20

infinite entropy. Or does the universe gravitate to a universe of infinite =
order? Hot or Cold is the big=20
question. If, on the one hand we have an infinite number of quantized rando=
ms confined to a volume what is=20
the shape of that volume? In this case the shape of the volume will be a pe=
rfect sphere on acount an=20
infinite number of two or three constantly varying shapes would be at such =
compression as to form a=20
constant uniform surface or volume. Thus an infinite number of randoms equi=
lls perfect order...yet even in=20
such a universe we are measuring the randoms which must therefore exist. Th=
e measurement we made and the=20
deduction is in no way connected to the origins of the quantities existant =
therein by a subtransfinite=20
period. I say subtransfinite instead of infinite because I believe the univ=
erse is both finite and=20
infinite and that time and space are quatiized and any movement in them. Th=
usly I believe that the=20
distance in a finite space-time to infinity in this bounded space-time is f=
inite. Thus any numeral beyond=20

the barrier of the universe is not infinite but a finite number to big to f=
it in this universe so it=20

exists in the area beyond the present universe...the past or future. If mea=
sure infinity in the small beyond=20
any given center mass lies superluminosity and therefore past. The velocity=
 of light is the folcrum point=20
that exists in and marks the boundary between the infinite past and infinit=
e future.I imagine that at this=20
velocity one could part this reality and find another in the past or come i=
n contact with the future. Tell=20
me what would happen to matter if one were to burst infinitely into the fut=
ure and back in a splitt=20
second? I appologize I got side tracked this is supposed to be an inquisiti=
on to evaluate whether or not=20
science supports or crumbles Creation. I appologize I have tried to see how=
 a universe of nonexistance=20
could come into to existance in the form of an infinite number of randoms a=
nd I can see no logic in this=20
only a border created to establish the area of impossibility within for the=
 existance of a universe to=20
derive from nothing. But the relation that I see between the domain of non-=
existance and existance is=20
unstated. I would have said non-linear but even these mathematical interact=
ions acurr within the finite=20
universe. It would appear that only super finite actions could exist within=
 this region of nonexistance=20
thus defining this region an infinite(beyond finite). I see no place for no=
thing in existance. There is no=20
displacement within an infinite mass and I can therefore not see the possib=
lility of manufacturing a place=20
of non existance save by an infinite being who alone could traverse this cl=
ause to make a domain existant=20
seperated on all sides from the rest of existance by a border of absolute a=
bsolute infinite limit.=20

All of this is purely my own ascertaining so it more then likely contains s=
ome flaws. I also want to state=20
that I ment no insult by the way I stated my view up on top but this is mer=
ely how I learned to debate. I=20
assumed creation side of the arguement and stated what I could ascertain in=
 the hopes that others will=20
debate my claims so that I and others may gain knowlege.=20

Greetings and happy holidays everyone. I am very surprised and delighted to=
 see the conversation going in=20
the direction it has on this thread. Unknowingly, you all have stepped into=
 the real mystery of time=20
travel that remains speculative in 2036. Based on a couple of questions I s=
ee here, I will try my hardest=20
to describe what we in 2036 think space-time looks like and how it behaves.=
 Please keep in mind that I=20
realize how easy it is to dismiss what I say. First, I'm trying to do this =
from memory. Imagine you are=20
back in 1911 trying to explain a jet engine to the Wright brothers. However=
, there are some very basic=20
properties of quantum theory that support this model today. I appreciate th=
e fact that you are reading=20
this with an open mind.=20

(If parallel universes do exist, did they all start simultaneously? I mean,=
 let's assume that the universe=20
originated from a singularity. Were there any parallel universes at that po=
int? That would not be very=20
logical and it would also imply that there is a parallel universe in which =
our universe never existed.)=20

It is thought that the event called the "Big Bang" was the start of not onl=
y this worldline or universe but=20
all worldlines and all universes that make up the superuniverse. It is also=
 thought that the superuniverse=20
can be imagined as an expanding sphere with the big bang in the center.=20

Individual worldliness (or timelines as you call them) can be imagined as l=
ines originating at the center=20
and "trending" toward spiraling around the sphere until they reach the edge=
. The individual worldlines=20
expand in length and widen as you follow them from the center. Each individ=
ual "moment" or "event" on a=20
world line has infinite possibilities or outcomes. Imagine this as a single=
 point with infinite lines=20
shooting away from it, which in turn are made up of points with their own p=
ossibilities and outcomes. Now,=20
remember, these individual worldliness with all these points and possibilit=
ies are defined by their=20
ability to hold there inhabitants to timelike trips only (no faster than li=
ght travel).=20

Now consider the reality of a spinning or electrified black hole (Kerr). Pe=
nrose diagrams of these oddities=20
show mathematically that you can make simulated spacelike trips (faster tha=
n light) through the=20
singularity without being destroyed. In order to do this without wiping out=
 most modern physical laws, you=20
must travel to an alternate worldline or universe. Therefore, if multiple w=
orldlines exist, infinite=20
worldlines exist.=20

In trying to imagine a superuniverse with infinite possibilities and worldl=
ines, I think of a room with=20
mirrors on all the walls. You are aware of your captivity but as you look i=
n the distance, you see an=20
infinite number of "yours" in an infinite number of mirrored rooms. The gra=
vity distortion machine allows=20
you to "step" out of your room and into another next to you. The closer you=
 are to your original room, the=20

closer it looks like yours, the farther away, the stranger it looks to you.=

(...If I go forward on this world line, the future will not be my future. I=
 get home by going back to 1975=20
before I arrived and then going forward to 2036.")=20

A few people have asked me about this statement so I will try to clarify it=
.=20

On my worldline (A) in 2036, I was given a mission in 1975.=20

I turn my machine on and jump to another worldline (B) in 1975 with about a=
 2% divergence from (A).=20

From the very point I turn my machine off on (B), I create a new worldline =
just because I'm there. This=20
line can be described as (C) and started when I got to (B).=20

I am now doing my mission on line (C) in 1975 when I discover a very a good=
 reason to go forward on (C) and=20

see what happened. I turn my machine on and go forward on (C) to the year 2=
000.=20

When I turn it off, I start another line called (D). So from my perspective=
, here we are on line (D) in the=20
year 2000. In order to go home to line (A) I must turn my machine on and go=
 back on (D) until I reach (C)=20
which in turn would take me back to (B) which in turn takes me to a point b=
efore I arrived on (B) then I=20
go forward from the point I arrived on (B) back to (A).=20

If all this isn't enough to get your head spinning...here are some issues w=
e're dealing with in 2036.=20

1. Did your worldline (D) exist at all before I got here from (C)? (persona=
lly I don't see how it couldn't)=20

2. What happens at the end of a worldine at the edge of the superuniverse?=
=20

3. If there are infinite worldlines and infinite possibilities and an edge =
to the superuniverse, doesn't=20
that mean occurring events on worldliness are staggered as they reach the e=
dge? (time could end at any=20
moment without warning).=20

It involves the travel of information at faster than light. In fact, I have=

You said you are confused by the 5100 story. I will explain further. In 203=

it would have probably destroyed a large part of their business infrastruct=
ure in the early 70s. In fact,=20

I would bet the engineers were probably told to keep their mouth's shut.=20


67=20





Therefore, if I were not here now telling you this, that information would =

and discover I am telling the=20

Does not chaos theory make such determinations impossible? Even if I gave y=

Actually, there are 2 singularities in the unit. The gravity field is manip=

There is no relative movement in space due to three main factors. Large, ki=

that I was taught to target a=20

I see your brand new here, so I can understand if you don't know the histor=

posts. Let me just say that yes Time Travel will be this worlds greatest te=

it becomes real (to this timeline that is).=20

However, unlike you who wishes to see this issue of Time Travel as a scient=
ist in an objective manner.=20

I choose to see this issue on a human/moral level. Is it ethical to Time Tr=

Where does that leave out normal hard working honest people? Apparently tha=

Therefore, as you can see, my only beef with Time Travel is that it can be =

It appears I may have publicly judged you too harshly. And I hereby appolog=

across as a personal attack. Your post above has opened the door to a world=
 of dialog that we may indeed=20
find a way to come together on. You are no longer the faceless, dogmatic sp=
ewer of antiquated rhetoric I=20
once thought you to be. (It does seem that this "paradox" issue has taken c=
onversation on this board into=20
directions I never thought possible. But then... God is the ultimate parado=
x is He/She not?)=20

Please understand that when you say ... "I do admit that the information I =
recieved came second hand so I=20

g but can't help myself when it=20

intended.=20

Please also understand that when you say I "...claims that creation is comp=

NOT claim THIS at all. I merely state (without CLAIMING anything at all) th=
at the account of creation as=20
is metaphorically described in the Book Of Genesis in The Bible, first vers=
ion, is just that. A metaphor.=20
Not a true depiction of actual history in the literal sense.=20

I'm not disclaiming the existence of God here, or the CONCEPT of Creation p=
er se. Nor am I saying that in=20
so denying, that I am therefore subscriptive to the A-Theistic point of vie=
w. On the contrary.=20

In the true sprit of Paradox, (which this thread's topic is all about), I m=
erely offer the easily=20
verifiable evidence and duplicatable proof that such an occurance as the so=
-called Biblically depicted=20
"great flood" is in itself a physically impossibility.=20

It would be a great leap of faith indeed for anyone to PRESUME from this st=
atement that I in any way=20
dispute the existence of God. But also be aware that while I do not refute =
His existence, I also do not=20
accept it unconditionally. At least based on the words of one anthology tha=
t exists from the ancient days=20
of Western European Mythology. Particularly since this Anthology to which I=
 refer (The Bible) never=20
existed in it's present form until the late 15th Century when Guttenburg in=

brought all these previously unconnected "Books" together. And even then, a=
fter much language translation=20
from various sources such as Hebrew, Islamic, Christian, etc.=20


74=20





To place scientific credibility in such a document would be folly on the "w=
ishful thinkers" of the world to=20
say the least.=20

This is not to say that the document does not have value as a representativ=
e example of the moralistic=20
values in any society in folklore, (including our own), but it needs to be =
studied in the true context of=20
what it is. A historical account of the world as THOSE WHO LIVED AT THAT TI=
ME saw it. The moral lessons=20
contained therin may indeed be timeless, but the science is purly from the =
point of view of the then=20
ignorant. (No offense to them, they simply didn't know any better.)=20

So ultimately Mr. Schasteen, please understand that from what I see in your=
 last post, we may indeed not be=20
that far apart on the moralistic or philosophistic level, but at the purely=
 scientific level, well, as=20
Einstein said, "God does not play Dice with the Universe."=20

And He (if he truly exists), DID NOT flood the entire Earth 6000 years ago,=
 nor did He "create" the Earth=20
in a matter of what we call "six days".=20

"He" MAY very well have "Created" it, and the rest of the Universe for that=
 matter. I take no issue with=20
this nor do I advocate the possibility either way. I'll leave the possibili=
ty of these matters to the=20
likes of Dr. Stephen Hawking and others of his ilk who can present logical =
arguments that support BOTH=20
points of view far better than my humble ability to elaborate upon.=20

For specifics though, I've already provided links to a number of sites wher=
e raidiometric dating processes=20
can be studied and understood (I'll leave you to chase those down and do th=
e same research I've already=20
done), and hopefully leave you with the understanding that I also meant NO =
insult to you in any personal=20
way.=20

After all, "rgrunt" and "DaViper" are just handles anyone can use to sign o=
nto a BBS/Message board anywhere=20
on the net and represent themselves to be anyone they wish to present thems=
elves as.=20

In the end, it's the words and what one has to say that matter here.=20

And very little else.=20

Peace.=20

Hi everyone,=20

Pamela, to respond to your previous post:=20

yes, we've had some snow over here, but it's raining cats and dogs again as=
 usual..=20

From our point of view, lets just say "this worldline", timetravel does not=
 yet exist. To put it in other=20
words: timetravel will (probably) exist in the future, but assuming time go=
es by in chronological order it=20
does not exist yet.=20

If we take a "non-linear" approach to time, timetravel does indeed already =
exist. It all just depends on=20
the way you look at things. I guess we're both right in this case.=20

As for Timetravel_0. I'm very sceptic about the story he has provided us wi=
th. But it remains an=20

interesting story nonetheless. It doesn't matter whether we believe it or n=
ot. At least he's caused a 6=20
page thread and he made people think about certain aspects of modern societ=
y. It's only logical that=20
someone from the future has no gain in proving that he really is a timetrav=
eler.=20

So lets just stick to the subject of timetravel instead of proving or dispr=
oving the story of Timetravel_0.=20

As for Juanito and TimeTravelActivist. Listen very carefully, I shall only =
say this once Perhaps it's a=20
good idea to start a new thread called "The Resistance" or something simila=
r. That would be a great=20
opportunity to discuss the "danger" of timetravel and recruit new members.=

The thing that I picked up from Mr. TT_0's recent post is that he seemed to=

not just take in what others may say. If people just sat around saying I be=

definitively accept or deny TT_0's claim of being an actual time traveller =
until physical and hence=20
experimental proof of time travel is obtained.=20

My past inquiries of TT_0 were merely for my curiousity. I have never accep=
ted or denied his claim.=20

Although, I must admit the easiest and most uncomplicated solution would be=
 that he is not. As far as that=20

Dear P-Light,=20

I appologize for the delay. I am now teaching myself geometry and calculas =
for I did not have the=20
opportunity to learn these forms of math in high school. I was lucky to get=
 a chance to learn algebra.=20
After I have finished teaching myself these subjects I believe that I will =
have the knowlege to convert=20
the theory behind the black hole device into a mathematical statement using=
 calculas. Graphic proofs are=20
great but all of the physics journals I have read are written using calcula=
s to represent mathematically=20
whatever measurement is being discussed in that particular journal. As for =
the device itself in light of=20
my lack of education I went ahead and contracted it's development to a rese=
arch and development firm by=20
the name of Davison and Associates. The device is to be a generator for sal=
e. But the generator operates=20
on the same theory in that increase in electrical current and voltage is ob=
tained by constricting a=20
parallel probagating e and h field to a smaller given space. I am not aware=
 of whether compressing and=20
electric field or an electric field will power output of a generator but I =
know that focusing a magnetic=20
field to a smaller area increases the strength of the field in that area li=
ke sunlight focused through a=20
convex lense. And I believe one way to increase the electrical output of a =
generator is to increase the=20
field strength of the magnets being used to generate the electricity. So I =
cannot see why the device will=20
no produce higher electrical voltages at higher amperage, (all parts are po=
wered by dc current)If one=20
tries to focus a magnetic field that is generated by an alternating current=
 the field will decrease in=20
amperage as the field is constricted on acount that the frequency of the fi=
eld is increased as the field=20
is twisted up. Imagine a spring, if you will, and let each revolution in th=
e helixical spring determine=20
the frequency. If you twist the sring in the one direction the distance bet=
ween the spring crests and=20
troughs will decrease as the spring is tightened thus increasing the freque=
ncy of the spring. As a ac=20
current frequency increases the ac output decreases. I imagine that dc is d=

my interpritation of the ac theorum I just stated.=20

In 2036, community life is a bit different. People are valued and judged ba=
sed on their contribution and=20
worth. Work is organized around the family and the value of that work is as=
sessed inside of the community.=20
Most communities range in size from 1000 to 4000 people. If a family wanted=
 to move from one community to=20

or not the work or skill they have is required or necessary to that individ=

Assuming time travel is possible. I do not see how one could band it from b=

one even know that it was used? If you buy into the multiple universe intre=

would not the time traveller simply pop out of existence in our universe ne=

it be possible to band time travel in the infinite multitude of parallel un=
iverses, since each universe=20
represents one of an infinite albeit different sequence of events/choices? =
To "fight" against the infinite=20
diversity of existence in all of its infinite combinitations does not seem =
logical (at least to me that=20
is). And if you do not buy the multiverse idea, then if time travel is to b=
e used it can not be stopped=20
since time travel would only be possible on closed time like curves, i.e. s=
elf-fulfilling destinies in a=20
manner of speaking. Personally, I do not even see how it is possible for on=
e to realize that they were in=20
a closed timelike loop much less escape it. For all things would be as they=
 were as they are and as they=20

an unchangeable fate, for whatever actions we take we were destined to and =
no matter what technologies we=20
may think up would be able to erase the mistakes of our past or change the =
past course of our existence.=20
And if that is in fact the case, the only real benefit time travel would ha=

Good evening, morning , or afternoon everybody.=20

For a year or two I have started to pay attention to a phenomenon that most=
 people including myself had=20
noticed but taken for granted. The phenomenon is that some days appear to b=
e longer then others. I cannot=20
count the number of times that I felt it was 5:30 pm in the afternoon then =
go to check the clock and=20
notice that it is only 2:00 pm, merely an hour after I had last checked. Al=
so, I cannot count the number=20
of times that I have thought that it was 2:00 pm in the afternoon and go to=
 check the clock only to find=20
out that it is 5:30 pm. One or two years ago I began to suspect that time i=
tself was indeed fluctuating.=20

So on days that felt longer I asked others if the day was going by fast to =
them. To my surprize the answer=20
was unanimous. Everyone also felt that the day was going by slower then usu=
al, too. I was looking at an=20
astronomy book last week and noted that space-time is expanding. At the beg=
ining of the universe the=20
temperatures of the universe was extremely high and decreased as space expa=
nded. Now I questioned whether=20
there would be any difference if the actual size of the universe were getti=
ng bigger as the universe=20
expanded keeping space uniform in density or whether the size of the unifor=
m were fixed and the addition=20
of new space-time resulted in an everincreasing space-time density. I reaso=
ned that the results would be=20
the same for energy occupies space. If the quantity of energy is kept const=
ant and more and more space is=20
crammed into the quantity energy ones first intuition is to assume that the=
 energy per unit volume will=20
increase as a result of the increased compression of space. But this is wro=
ng in fact the energy per unit=20
volume will decrease as a result of compressed space. The reason is that wh=
en one compresses a greater=20
quantity of space-time into a constant quantity of energy the energy occupi=
es a greater volume of space.=20

As energy occupies more space the density of the energy decreases as a resu=
lt of expansion of the energy=20
which is defined as energy occupying greater volumes of space. Now If mass =
occupies a greater quantity of=20
energy: the energy(that is not mass) will expand and decrease in density. A=
lso energy is generated by=20
friction as the mass is crushed to a smaller volume. This extra energy is n=
eglected in the former=20
statement in that it is the free energy in the form of heat/light that we a=
re interested in not the energy=20
created by the crushing of the mass nor the energy added by the exertion of=
 kenetic force to crush the=20
mass to a smaller volume. As mass increases the energy expands. As energy i=
ncreases mass expands=20
decreasing in density which is the principle behind the function of hot air=
 baloons. As space increases=20
exponentially and as the number of points increases exponentially the densi=
ty of space is increased. As=20
the density of space is increased the temperature of space is decreased as =
the constant thermal energy=20
constant occupies more space. If space increased from all pionts no energy =
will be created by friction=20
since no space is forced to move into tighter quantities on acount that the=
 number of points is increased=20
symetrically to the increase in volume of space. Now as energy is increased=
 per unit volume time becomes=20
accelerated for that volume as is manifested in a heated object as the mole=
cules of a heated object is=20
sped up relative molecules in cooler masses outside that object.=20

down for that object on acount that time is a measurement of a number of ev=

of events.(if the velocity is=20

You still didn't answer my questions. Instead you went off the subject, and=
 attempted to blame me for=20
something I have no control over.=20

Let's set the record straight here. If TimeTravel is used wisely, ethically=
, and with intentions that don't=20
allow for an advantage in which ever side is using it. Then I am fine with =
it.=20

But, if it is used to go back and change events in favor of a world governm=

would like them to be punished. How would you like to be exploited? Who lik=

So in retro-pects, I sense you have anger in me, for having morals and a se=

Time Travel. I don't want this ability to be used by eager selfish people w=

So in conclusion, I still await your answers to my questions. What do you h=

I mean no disrespect, but you don't seem to have the wisdom that I would ex=

You mentioned a divergence from time lines. How is it possible to measure s=

that it would be impossible to calculate how causes of one single event wou=

Does not chaos theory make such determinations impossible? Even if I gave y=

velocity of all objects in the universe (which is impossible(I can not even=
 give you the exact position=20
and velocity of a single object due to the Heisenberg Uncertainity Principl=

the future holds. Of course this results from the fact that the objects do =

You said 6 curled up dimensions. The current theory suggests that there sho=
uld be at least 7 curled up=20
dimensions. It was discovered by Ed Witten that if you added an additional =
dimension that the 5 slightly=20
different versions of string theory would combine into a single theory, whi=

((You mentioned a divergence from time lines. How is it possible to measure=
 such a divergence?))=20

The measurement for worldline divergence is an observation variable isolate=
d to the distortion unit. An=20
effective analogy would be a "gravity radar". The unit's sensors take a "sn=
apshot" of the local gravity=20
around the unit before a flight. During travel, this baseline is periodical=
ly checked to make sure there=20
are no major changes in the environment that would cause a catastrophic mas=
s failure (brick wall appearing=20
from nowhere). The percentage of VGL divergence from one worldline to anoth=
er is a calculated guess by the=20
three computers that control the unit based on its starting point. It is us=
eless in describing=20
characteristics of individual worldlines.=20

There is a bit of folklore about the first distortion driver who reaches a =
destination with a zero=20
divergence. This would mean they had traveled on a spacelike trip to their =
own worldline of origin. This=20
paradox is quite possible although highly unlikely. I wonder if anyone out =
there can take current string=20
theory and make that one work on paper?=20

((You said 6 curled up dimensions. The current theory suggests that there s=
hould be at least 7 curled up=20

I may be mistaken but I thought it was pretty well established now that (N =

I see you take things from this world to bring back to your own world, book=

Do you pay for those items? or do you just "steal" them?=20

could not a TT (time traveler)basically take whatever they wanted from any =

for example: They would have knowledge of when a shipment of gold was being=
 transported by truck and they=20
could go in and attack the truck and steal all the gold, which would be goo=

do what ever he wanted with it.=20

They could set themselves up as a King in ancient Egypt and rule the world =
at the time.=20

They will have all the power and all the money they could ever want.on this=
 world as well as on others.=20

what stops you from doing this as well?=20

Are they careful who they pick to time travel? do you have to take psycholo=
gical tests before you are=20
chosen?=20

what attributes should a time traveler have in your opinion?=20

What are some things they look for when they chose someone for a mission?=

If they pick a bad seed by mistake and send them time traveling and that pe=

they can go after that person? I am curious about all of this.=20

I was considering all the pictures that were submitted of UFO'S on all the =

lievable then time travel. Not=20
that I am a skeptic of time travel for if I were I would not be trying to p=

evidence can be produced over the internet to convince even a minute few th=

I would say that collective seeing on a constant basis such that sightings =
become as routine as eating=20

I was considering using the superluminal waveguide where microwaves are for=

that the group velocity is greater then light as resonance to enable the ir=

conduct the tachyons from my source by decreasing the density of space-time=
 that seperates the tachyon=20
source from the subluminal energy source and thus correcting the space and =
time dialation of the=20
superluminal and subluminal entities within the iron antena. This will decr=
ease the density seperating the=20
subluminal energies from the superluminal energies and increase the magnitu=

permiating our iron antena. (please forgive any mispellings I am in quite a=
 hurry). This is all just an=20
extra I believe that the above is not necesary but will serve as maybe a tu=

 then creating a pressure on=20
the field by running a conducter through the field of infinite density will=

will conduct the tachyons at a higher probability rate as the fields increa=

With all do respect timetravelactivist, I am somewhat relieved that you can=

the information being delivered. Some info is better left to the experts wh=
ich is why I am not building my=20
own invention. You are not the only one who is aprehensive of the prospects=
 and consequences of the=20
development of time travel. One who I would call a friend is borderline par=

threatened recourse any such device is developed. I can honestly say that m=
y original intention was not=20
the development of a time travel device, but an energy source to enable the=
 production and distribution of=20
massive amounts of energy for industrial use and/or consumption. The nature=
 of the device as I developed=20
it revealed quite accidently the possibility of yielding sufficient energy =
for the manipulation of time=20
itself. It appears that the two limiting factors that are holding back tech=

limitation of energy and energy containment. It is like we used to say in a=
ircraft mechanic school, if you=20
give anything enough thrust you can make it fly as is proven by every succe=

harrier fighter jet. If you can produce enough energy I suppose anything is=
 possible-even time travel. I=20
will tell you one thing though, I will not be detered from the development =
and inplementation of this=20
device-even if it must be developed behind closed doors. I feel that it is =
time for the world to take=20
serious measures into the energy crisis. We have, so I have heard, about tw=
enty-five years worth of fossil=20
fuels. Here is one possible temperary solution to prolong the consumption o=
f energy. I have heard that the=20
radio-active gas radon is quite plentiful on the lunar surface. Radon happe=
ns to be one of the radio=20
active gasses produced by the degradation of Uranium Metal. One option may =
be to develop NASA drilling=20
teams to go to the moon and search for uranium deposits. If there turns out=
 to be quite a large supply of=20
uranium on the lunar surface that we might be able to develop spacial conta=
iners to collect and preserve=20
uranium over the next 25 years while we still have the fuel sources to do s=
o. This might give us a couple=20
of hundred more years of electrical energy on our planet to research for an=
 answer to the energy crisis by=20
continueing research into discovering the ultimate energy source. Since the=
 current form of economy is=20
limiting us by being so dependend on oil and other competitive businesses I=
 thought that maybe a new=20
economy system would be worth considering.=20

If we were to take the economic losses acruid by businesses that fail to su=
cceed on the open market and set=20
up a virtual account and allow that estimated monetary loss to be recircula=
ted back into the economic=20
system in the form of virtual tender in the account of the failed business =
to spend only on research and=20
development. The failed business can use the cash to develop advanced produ=
cts for sell. The failed=20
business is then free to spend the profits gained by the newly developed pr=
oducts for personal gain of=20
that business. The bussiness can pay a small tax on the money gained to sup=
port the goverment. The oil=20
companies will be satisfied for no inventions can put them out of business =
on account that any losses=20

acruid by the oil companies as a result of alternate energy sources can be =
claimed by the oil companies in=20

the form of virtual cash for them to spend on other products such as comput=
ers and etc. The more worthy=20
competition the oil companies gain the more money the oil companies gain wh=
ich is true for everyone. The=20
oil companies will promote the development of advanced tachnologies both on=
 their own and by supporting=20
the competition. Everyones losses will be everyones gains. We can still all=
ow the current money system be=20
usable but can also allow for monetary systems to be kept on massive comput=
er acounts in the form of=20
supercomputers. By having this set up we will use the natural human trait o=
f greed to reinforce our=20
development and in the mean time decrease the crime rate by allowing all pe=
rsons to have the right to=20
purchase shares of a given business through the stock market. I bet that we=
 if this system will allow=20
every one to gain that we would have no problem getting people to sign peti=

P.S. You might be wondering why the new name. Well I got the idea for this =
name after playing this cool RPG=20
game. "The Wheel of Time." Just thought I use a new name, as a change of pa=

In the post that follows, I've tried to answer the latest questions directe=
d at me but I am hoping you all=20
may be able to add some insight into something I've noticed. In our attempt=
 to communicate here, some of=20
the comments on this board have become increasingly hostile and negative. I=
 see the same type of=20
interaction when I watch news interview programs. The guise of productive i=
nteraction and communication is=20
thwarted by illogical verbal attacks and misdirection. I understand why the=
 news does it. They are trying=20
to hold an audience by generating conflict. For a while, I thought that was=
 the goal here too but it=20
appears that anger and conflict is being created on this site to cause genu=
ine harm and pain.=20

Its hard for me to believe that this is being done on purpose so I have con=
cluded I simply do not=20
understand some hidden element of your collective social interaction. On th=
e other hand, if its being done=20
for no reason, I would understand a little better how people in this time c=
ould accomplish so much and yet=20

be so vulnerable to their emotions and fears. I think it was Thomas Jeffers=
on who believed that the only=20

way to sway opinion was through calm, respectful, intelligent conversation.=
=20

Weather I'm a time traveler or not, I suppose there are numerous ways to vi=
ew my "story". By the nature of=20
the communication medium, I believe it's impossible to prove therefore it's=
 impossible to believe. I agree=20
that conversation spurs ideas. If I'm not a time a time traveler, than perh=
aps the seemingly disjointed=20
statements I make will actually create the idea in one of you that leads to=
 "real" time travel.=20

(What is a WORLDLINE?)=20

Individual worldlines represent the limits and paths physical objects take =
through space-time under the=20
laws of special relativity. They can be shown graphically on an x-y graph w=
ith x representing distance in=20
space and y representing passing of time. In time travel talk, worldlines a=
re used as a way to describe=20
and separate the experiences of a time traveler because various laws of spe=
cial relativity appear to=20

breakdown and can't be defined on a single worldline. Worldline has also be=
come synonymous with "alternate=20

universe" and / or "time line".=20

((I see you take things from this world to bring back to your own world, bo=
oks, computers what have ya. as=20
well as probably the other TT do as well.=20

Do you pay for those items? or do you just "steal" them?=20

what do you pay with if you pay?))=20

I pay for these items with money. Personally, I believe stealing is wrong.=
=20

((...could not a TT (time traveler) basically take whatever they wanted fro=
m any time?))=20

There are mass limits to what can be taken back.=20

( (... do you have to take psychological tests before you are chosen? what =
attributes should a time traveler=20
have in your opinion?))=20

Yes, there are numerous psychological tests. I was chosen based on my educa=
tional background and military=20
service. The training lasted about two years. There is a great deal of phys=
ical training to counter the=20
physical effects of distortion. They were also looking for drivers who had =
a fair amount of self-=20
sufficiency and an ability to function under extreme isolation and confinem=
ent.=20

((What are some things they look for when they chose someone for a mission?=
))=20

Depending on the mission, time travelers are usually chosen for a particula=
r mission based on their ability=20
to gain the cooperation of someone related to the goal on the target worldl=
ine. In my case, my grandfather=20
was directly involved with the building and programming of the 5100.=20

((If they pick a bad seed by mistake and send them time traveling and that =
person does harm is there anyway=20
they can go after that person? I am curious about all of this.))=20

Interesting question. There is a difference of philosophy between us that s=
hould be clarified. Since I=20
believe that all possible outcomes and events are possible, probable and ce=
rtain, it is impossible to=20
assign "goodness" or "badness" to a person or situation. On some other worl=
dline, I am an insane time=20
traveler causing destruction and death while TTA chases me with his band of=
 devoted followers. However, on=20
this one, I am not. Since both events are certain, their value is neutral.=
=20

Therefore, you can only assign goodness and badness to the events and exper=
iences you have direct control=20
over or witness. Only actions are good and bad, not people or things. I sup=
pose if I was a psychotic=20
killer, I could accomplish my mission, avoid capture and still return to my=
 worldline of origin without=20
penalty. There would be no way for them to know what happened. However, I b=
elieve that action is wrong and=20
I would be accountable to my God.=20

((Interesting, if you are from the future, you could tell us just exactly w=
hat IT is. Since no one will=20
know for sure until probably 2002 according to news reports. The picture th=
at I saw on ABCNEWs.com of what=20
they thing IT is did not seem to impressive.))=20

I suppose this question is my own fault. As a time traveler, I am expected =
to know every winning horse and=20
hot stock as well as the weather in all parts of the world at all times. I =
was genuinely interested in=20
your opinion of how "it" was being presented and advertised. Do you feel ma=
nipulated? Do you think it's=20
really a big deal? Do you like the way the news is dealing with it?=20

( (...didnt TT_0 say in a previous post that we were looked down on by futu=
re generations, if he is from a=20
"parellel timeline",how would he know this??))=20

This worldline and my own are almost exactly alike.=20

((How is this any different from TT_1 making claims and then sidestepping a=
ll attempts to get him to show=20
verifiable evidence to back them up?))=20

Did you mean TT_0 or TT_1?=20

((They were about his intentions as a Time Traveler. Ethical, or not? Disre=
garding his own Time line by=20
spilling the beans. Says alot, don't you think.))=20

How do you think my actions here affect my own worldline?=20

((P.S. You might be wondering why the new name. Well I got the idea for thi=
s name after playing this cool=20
RPG game. "The Wheel of Time." Just thought I use a new name, as a change o=
f pace.))=20

Ok man, I have to had it to you. Your smart, and know how to please a crowd=

your coming here and saying your a Time Traveler is a bit suspect. I know, =
that you have a hidden agenda.=20
You have not made clear your motives, and are only giving us very little pr=

I still believe your buying into people's fascination. Your a good study in=

(You sure your not some corporate PR guy).?=20

Which is probably why so many people believe your story. But your not Anti-=

have ever been manipulated by a Time Travelers plan for 21 years.=20

Which is not to say they are, and you just don't know it.=20

Am I right, TT_0? You do alot of work in the background of our society, adm=
it it. Adjusting things to fit=20

n the past.=20

You know, I don't know why you keep making me look like the bad guy here. A=

What are your personal beliefs TT_0? You said you believe in God, which one=
? Honestly, do you think the=20
ends justifies the means? Don't you have people regulating Time Travel?=20

You said your self you don't care what happens to your worldline. You don't=
 care about your actions, and=20
what they will affect?=20

You are a cheater of life... What ever happened to preservering against adv=

that we ALL would like to explore. On the contrary! It stimulates them. The=

 It's a great site. I=20

In the future, sociologists spend a great of time discussing the collective=
 mentality before the war that=20
led to the demise of "Homo Materia". Many of them point to an experiment th=
at was done in the 1970's or=20
1980 's. The experiment isolated various sizes of rat populations in varyin=
g cage sizes with varying food=20
and cleaning schedules. It was discovered that no matter what, there was a =
certain ratio of rats to space=20
that once overtaken by population would always lead to aggressive and destr=
uctive behavior in the rats=20
until enough of them had died or been killed to get back under the ratio. T=
his was true even when the rats=20
that were given plenty of food and had their cage cleaned every day. Beside=

office shooting and violent video game, I can't help but think about that e=
xperiment every time I see=20
someone stranded on the highway or walking on the side of the road carrying=

parents why we don't stop and help and they tell me they are afraid of bein=

g out that it's our duty to=20
help someone, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because we c=
an never know that person's=20
true worth and the risk of losing then is too great. I didn't fully underst=
and their stubbornness until I=20
saw a news story about a doctor who was sued for applying emergency first a=

Although TTA is a bit quirky and eccentric, he does belong to us. He's this=
 community's quirky and=20

eccentric guy and although he can be aggravating, I can't help but feel pro=
tective of him. As I'm sure=20
most of us believe, under all of his postings, he has some interesting thin=
gs to say. When I first read=20
one of his postings, I first shake my head and then I begin to question my =
own understanding of not only=20
the English language but of the real meaning of the odd things he brings up=
. If it's done on purpose, it's=20
quite effective. I am often forced to go back through the dictionary or gra=
mmar handbook just to make sure=20
there's not some obscure punctuation or grammar rule I was unaware of.=20

As an example, when I read his mission statement, I do think the effect of =
not writing a complete sentence=20
before the period is dramatic but I am forced to examine the word "it's" an=
d wonder if it represents the=20
contraction for "it is" or if it means the possessive of the understood sub=
ject from the first part.=20

Please understand, I do not point this out to cause harm. People are often =
first judged by the way they=20
write and speak. I can't help but think a great deal of anger is a result o=
f frustration to make ourselves=20
understood. Throughout our lives, a real understanding of how to communicat=
e would help anyone express=20
themselves better. As I find myself double checking how to use the English =
language I only recommend that=20
TTA do the same. I am quite anxious to his ideas or set of rules on the use=
 of time travel.=20

Although, I do not wish to take sides in this argument. TTA if you re-read=
=20
what you quoted, you will notice something.=20


(Have you considered the possible adverse consequences the person might fac=
e that you had post them for you=20

read the information and attempt to build one? what if they get injured in =
the process because they are=20
not knowledgeable enough to handle the forces they are playing with at this=
 "time".)=20

Yes, I have considered it but it is very easy to remain hidden behind a vei=
l of disbelief. The people who=20
understand what they are seeing are not aggressive. Everyone else just find=
s them entertaining. The=20
obvious first answer is that the only world line of consequence is my own a=
nd I don't care what happens=20
here. That however, is not the case. I have shown these documents in order =
that people might consider the=20
possibility. I do not expect people to believe them.=20


TT_0 says that the obvious first answer to the question is that he must not=
 care for what happens on any=20
worldline except for his own. But notice immediately after that sentence he=
 says that is not however the=20
case. That the true answer is that he just wanted people to consider the po=

It has been fascinating to read your insights on the social flaws during th=

not a part of this society (or at least new to it) it is more obvious for y=
ou than many of us.=20

Your observations strike a deep meaning with me, because I've spent the las=
t 4 years writing a science=20
fiction audio drama about the greed of humanity around the year 2000.=20

What disturbs me is that, yes, there are many who understand these problems=
 of greed. Most of us know it=20
exists, but cannot attribute the source. Some think greed is the necessary =
thread which tightly holds our=20
economy together. There are the many that just accept greed as the normal w=
ay of life, even though they=20
know there is something wrong about it. Action is never taken to fix the mi=
ndset of what money is really=20

There are always those who enjoy cheating, weaseling, and playing tricks to=
 gain false respect. Those=20
people thrive on knowing how to get ahead. As long as they win their steadf=

satisfaction, they will always influence others. It doesn't matter how many=

Mr. TT_0,=20

Let us assume you are a time traveller. I do not see any viable way for you=
 to return to your own time line=20
then. I say this because that you mentioned the difficulty with time travel=
 in the sense of divergences.=20
You said that you travelled back in time from 2036 to 1975 with a ~l-2% div=
ergence. You also mentioned=20
that in your time frame a 0% divergence is sort of a myth, i.e technologica=
lly improbable. Now if I=20
understand your plan, you say you will once again travel back to 1975 befor=
e you arrived and then go=20
forward as to avoid going into the future of our time line, which by your p=
resence here would be an=20
alternate future from your own. But what I would ask is, if you plan to go =
back to 1975 from 2000, you=20
should incur a certain non-zero percent divergence just as you did going fr=
om 2036 to 1975. I would=20
surmize that it is impossible or technologically improbable for you to go b=
ack to the exact world line you=20
departed from then. Even if you are able to travel back with a 0% divergenc=
e, which by your previous words=20
would be mythological, what would ensure you that the future you travelled =
into was exactly the world line=20
you left. Since there are an infinite number of possible world lines depart=
ing from 1975 into the future.=20

I suppose the key point of this argument is that any trip through time with=
 your technology would result=20
in a non-zero divergence, and in order for you to arrive in your own world =
line you must create a 0%=20
divergent trip. This is amusing in the sense that the harder you try to get=
 to your own world line the=20
more divergences you incur and hence the furthur away you get. I believe I =
see the birth of a new temporal=20
paradox.=20

Dear Everyone,=20

I was thinking yesterday and came up with an addition to a conscept I stumb=
led into last week while=20
thinking.=20

I was reading a book on astronomy that states that the universe is expandin=
g. Now as the unverse expands=20
the temperature of the universe decreases. The author that wrote the book s=
tated that scientist now=20
believe that micro seconds after the big bang there was one super force com=
posed of strong force, weak=20
force, and electromagnetic force. Gravity was seperate from these forces at=
 that time as it is today...so=20
they say. As the universe expanded and cooled this super force broke up int=
o three seperate forces;=20
strong, weak, and electromagnetic. This is what I propose. I believe that s=
pace is confined to a fixed=20
shpere of a fixed size and more space is added so that the pressure of the =
space begins to build up and=20
the density of space begins to increase. One would normally think that comp=
ressing space would result in=20
an increase in the temperature of space as a result of the compression of e=
nergy that is confined to that=20
region of space. However I believe the opposite is true. To compress space =
by increasing the volume of=20
space is to confine the energy within that region of compressed space to a =
greater volume of space. This=20
results in a decrease to the density of energy. If one doubles the volume o=
f space that a quantity of=20
energy occupies, the energy density of that energy will be equall to the in=
verted square of the density of=20
the new density of space. (S=3Dl/e A 2) where s=3Dnew density of space, and=
 e=3Dthe density of energy occupying=20
that space. Further more, I believe that energy is also expanding at the sa=
me rate as space. One might=20
say, if this is so then why does the energy density of space decrease as sp=
ace expands? If the increase of=20
energy is proportionate to the increase of space, then shouldn't the space-=
time temperature remain=20
constant? The answer, quite counterintuitively, is no. The reason is that e=
ven if a quantity of space=20
doubles and the energy in that space also doubles, the new energy and space=
 must form around the old=20
energy and space because the new energy and space cannot occupy the same re=
gion. This of course does not=20
explain the differential in energy density from space density. The reason t=
hat energy density deacreases=20
is because to quanta of energy that are closer to one another gain extra de=
nsity. This manifested in a=20
magnetic field for as the photons increase there distance as they stray fro=
m each other the density of the=20
field and strength of the field decreases. The oldest energy is closer then=
 the new energy. The increase=20
in density decreases the density of space in the old energies region and in=
creases the density of space in=20
the new energies region. This creates the warping of the space-time continu=
um that is present in a dense=20
grouping of energy. Got to goe=20

The mulitiverse theory, basicly, is that everything that can happen, does h=
appen. It doesn't 'decide' to=20
split if you change history, or if two snowflakes collide or don't. The pos=
sibilities already exist.=20

Anyway, who's to say we have free will or thought? For all we know we could=
 be playing a role, like=20
mindless zombies. Not a pleasant thought, but just as possible as anything =
else.=20

I guess the big question is why? If there are infinite universes, what woul=
d the point be of their=20
existence? If time travel is possible, it would prevent paradoxes. Is that =
the only reason, like some sort=20
of self preservation mechanism?=20

why are you so sure that the universe is expanding? the only evidence for a=
 big bang is the doppler effect=20
of the light from the surrounding stars and galaxies. What if this effect i=
s caused, not by expansion, but=20
by the pattern of light slowing down as it enters our galaxy.=20

It makes equal sense that if manipulation of space is possible, then space =
itself is a force occupied only=20
within a galaxy. The goal would be to create a void within space equal to t=
hat outside the galaxy (where=20
there would be no gravity.) This idea is based on a non-gravity universe, w=
here gravity only exists within=20
galaxies.=20

Therefore galaxies do not attract each other, and do not risk being hurled =
into a big bang. Instead they=20
are freely floating in a nuetral environment where light can travel much fa=
ster between them.=20

Light then slows down as it enters the force of a galaxy and creates a patt=
ern we see as the doppler=20
effect.=20

This means that light speed is related only to the amount of galaxy force i=
t is traveling through. If you=20
create a void within the galaxy force, then light could travel faster, and =
then relative to that of=20
course, would be time travel.=20

the how energy and space interact. The theory you proposed also sounds like=
 a viable alternative to the=20
current model. I believe that there are limits to every field and that at s=
ome distance from a given=20
grouping of mass there is zero gravity. For example, if you quantize space =
and allow for a device pump=20
space into a given container such as cup that has an internal temperature o=
f 91degrees farhenheit, then=20
the temperature in that cup will decrease more as the numerical quantity of=
 thermal photons occupy a=20
greater volume of space. Basically as an electromagnetic field occupies a g=
reater volume of space the=20
density and strength of that field decreases. Now if one were to vacuum out=
 the space from the cup that is=20
91 degrees farhenheit, then the temperature within that cup will increase s=

quantity of the thermal photons within that space occupy a lesser volume of=
 space. Basically, as an=20
electromagnetic field(or any other photon mediated field) contracts to occu=
py a lesser volume of space,=20
the strength and density of that field will increase. This goes right along=
 with your own theory about=20
areas outside the galaxies. For an area with zero densityand infinity energ=
y density the velocity the=20
vacuum velocity of light will increase without bounds. If one decreases the=
 energy density within a given=20

I am not at all convinced that the universe is expanding. I was in such a h=
urry to post due to time=20
constraints that I was not able to post my views accurately. I appologize f=
or the confusion. I am more=20
convinced that the universed is fixed and not expanding. I believe God when=
 he says that nothing can be=20
added and nothing taken away. But at the same time I am not fully convinced=
 that the universe is entirely=20
a closed system either. I believe that energy can be formed at an area wher=
e no energy is present by=20
drawing energy from beyond the center of a measured region.=20

I call the area beyond the centermass of every particle and field subpoint =
space because it is an area that=20
exists beyond the centermass. This is my theory and it is not even a theory=
 yet. It is truelly a=20
hypothesis. In a littly while I may be able to produce evidence to support =
or deny my hypothesis. As soon=20
as I have confirmed the viability of my claims or lack there of, I might po=
st the results. The conscept I=20
was trying to describe above is more related the how energy and space inter=
act. The theory you proposed=20
also sounds like a viable alternative to the current model. I believe that =
there are limits to every field=20

and that at some distance from a given grouping of mass there is zero gravi=
ty. For example, if you=20

quantize space and allow for a device pump space into a given container suc=
h as cup that has an internal=20
temperature of 91degrees farhenheit, then the temperature in that cup will =
decrease more as the numerical=20
quantity of thermal photons occupy a greater volume of space. Basically as =
an electromagnetic field=20
occupies a greater volume of space the density and strength of that field d=
ecreases. Now if one were to=20

vacuum out the space from the cup that is 91 degrees farhenheit, then the t=
emperature within that cup will=20

increase significantly as the numerical quantity of the thermal photons wit=
hin that space occupy a lesser=20
volume of space. Basically, as an electromagnetic field(or any other photon=
 mediated field) contracts to=20
occupy a lesser volume of space, the strength and density of that field wil=
l increase. This goes right=20
along with your own theory about areas outside the galaxies. For an area wi=
th zero densityand infinity=20
energy density the velocity the vacuum velocity of light will increase with=
out bounds. If one decreases=20
the energy density within a given region to zero then the space-time densit=
y within that region will=20
increase to infinity and the light speed velocity in that region will decre=
ase to zero absolute velocity.=20

Well, I don't have much confidence in the parallel timelines (multiuniverse=
 existance) theory of time. It=20
makes much better sense to consider time a property of motion in the 4th di=
mension (axis).=20

But if time is indeed a 4th dimension then it is always difficult to conver=
t that into a visual model that=20
our brains can understand.=20

What if time is a property of gravity... where you fall through time at a c=
onstant rate relative to the=20

gravity. Problem with this is that time would pass at different rates on di=
fferent planets (which hasn't=20
been proven either way).=20

If you imagine yourself, and everything else on Earth, falling through time=
. Then Newton's laws of motion=20
would apply to time. If an object is falling through time it will continue =
falling until a force stops it.=20
The force required to stop it (or accelerate it) is proportional to the vel=
ocity and mass. And there must=20
be an equal and opposite reaction to motion through time.=20


113=20



Using this (fictional) model how would you stop someone from falling throug=
h time, or accelerate them away=20
from it (back in time)?=20

You would need to understand the properties of the time-force, whether it i=
s related to gravity fields,=20
whether it is related directly to mass, or space.=20

Also this would delete the notion of parallel timelines. If one object were=
 to be pushed into an=20

acceleration away from the time force, then they would no longer exist in t=
heir previous position in=20
relation to everything else that is falling. Once they are placed in a loca=
tion behind the previous, and=20
began to fall again at a constant rate. Would they, or not, be in the past?=
 Would familiar objects be seen=20
around? ..existing in a previous time? Becuase you have to visualize it as =
another plane of existance. so=20
the other dimensions would be connected to it.=20

Like i said, its very hard to visualize the 4 dimensional properties. But p=
erhaps the "falling" model will=20
help.=20

as you said earlier..."Actually, in science, "Multiverse" theory is somethi=

lack of evidence. It crops up from time to time as a way to explain certain=
 SEEMING paradoxes like the EPR=20

doesn't mean it is so.=20

Tiny invisible rubber bands could explain gravity if it weren't for the fac=

Multiverse Theory is not automatically true because it "explains" some thin=
gs. Lot's of things explain=20
"some" things. Most of them are NOT true.=20

So help me here. Where did multiverse come from as a theory? Where is the o=

During the last coupla years, I have been looking at SAA, AutoDynamics in g=

Ricardo Carezani. Sometime in 1999, I began thinking about the possible deg=
radation of photonic energy by=20
the theoretical picograviton. The "tired photon" hypotheses, to explain the=
 smooth redshift variation with=20
respect to distance/time, have a number of (surmountable) problems. But, th=

for this smooth variation, (namely: BigBang), also has many problems.=20

Anisotropy of CMB:=20

In the image of the above link, I can see that there is a calico feature to=

the depths of the dark patches?=20
Is there data available to recalibrate the image to a different, (lower), c=

if one were to gather multiple images of the same patch of sky, would the c=
alico pattern remain strictly=20
identical? Over what period of time? The careful comparison of differing im=
ages could reveal the changes=20
as being instrumental artifacts or actual sky change.=20

I wildly wonder if there may be a nominal "rest state" for photonic radiati=
on? If, after a looong journey=20
through "space", the photonic energies are "wound down" by being bent hithe=

Greetings everyone. I've been a way for a while so I apologize for not gett=
ing back to these questions=20
sooner.=20

((First, where does your interest in the (our) U.S. Constitution stem from?=
 Why do you think it is so vital=20
for us to read and understand it?))=20

After the war, the United States had split into five separate regions based=
 on the various factors and=20
military objectives they each had. There was a great deal of anger directed=
 toward the Federal government=20
and a revival of states rights was becoming paramount. However, in their at=
tempt to create an economic=20
form of government, the political and military leaders at the time decided =
to hold one last Constitutional=20
Congress in order to present a psychological cohesion from the old system. =
During this Congress, the=20
leaders discovered and decided that coming up with a new and better form of=
 government was nearly=20
impossible. The original Constitution itself was not the problem it was the=
 ignorance of the people that=20
lived under it.=20

((Second, do you not like your "new" Constitution? Or feel that it is not a=
s effective as the original?))=20

From my viewpoint, it's very effective. I am a very strong believer in loca=
l or state's rights.=20

((Third, you keep saying that you will be going back to your worldline soon=
, how soon will this be?))=20

There are certain windows I must wait for in order to leave. There will be =
two this year. The first one=20
opens this spring.=20

((Is it physically possible for you to get back to THIS time line once you =
leave?))=20

Not with the unit I have.=20

((If all 7 Billion of us here each had our own time machine do you think th=
at would we would end up=20
trashing the rest of the local worldlines?))=20

Since everything is already happening and possible on different worldlines,=
 the answer is yes....and no.=20

((Correct me if I'm wrong here but I see you as a Libertarian who expounds =
on the need for humanity to get=20
back to certain basics. Like the issues defined by the Constitution and you=
r comments earlier on firearms=20
tend to make me believe you are a Gun Rights activist.))=20

I suppose from your vantage point that's a fair assessment. I would call my=
self more of a centrist.=20

Although I understand the "gun rights" issue here, I cannot relate to it al=
l and it is a common point of=20
argument with my mother. I keep saying her tune will change in about ten ye=
ars and she'll be cleaning=20
shotguns in her sleep but it doesn't help. If it makes you feel any better,=
 I never shot anyone who wasn't=20
trying to kill me.=20

((could you give us your thoughts on how us "less enlightened" ones here in=
 this worldline of the here/now=20
can solve the technical problems of time travel so that we may be able to e=
njoy the same first hand=20
knowledge you have that gives you these social insights?))=20

When you say "us", what do you mean? Do you mean "you"? Where would you go =
if you had my machine? How do=20
you think the rest of the world would react to the U.S. having a time machi=
ne and they didn't? To tell you=20
the truth, I more worried about the computer system than I am the distrotio=
n unit.=20


115=20







((You said that you traveled back in time from 2036 to 1975 with a ~l-2% di=
vergence. You also mentioned=20
that in your time frame a 0% divergence is sort of a myth, i.e technologica=
lly improbable.))=20

Yes, a "ZD" is thought to be impossible. However, consider that an exact en=
try point "may" not be necessary=20
to get home. The important factor is the path, not the destination. Under m=
ultiple world theory, there are=20
an infinite number of "homes" that I could return to that don't have me the=
re. The divergence for that=20
window is somewhere near .002377%.=20

((Someone correct me where I'm wrong here but as I understand it, these Par=
allel Universes or Alternative=20
Timelines are "created" by events in our own, (timelines) or even in others=
.))=20

Parallel universes exist independently of each other and only interact to a=
void the collapse of the wave=20
function for any given particle that you are looking at. I like to imagine =
it as a series of parallel=20
lines crossed by a sine wave. Each point on the sine wave where a line cros=
ses it represents an alternate=20
outcome. The multiple "yous" on each worldline record a different result fo=
r the activity of the event.=20

((Actually, in science, "Multiverse" theory is something that has NEVER bee=
n proven. For lack of evidence.=20

It crops up from time to time as a way to explain certain SEEMING paradoxes=
 like the EPR double slit=20
experiment with polarized light. But then, just because it can be used to e=
xplain something doesn't mean=20
it is so.))=20

Greetings everyone. I've been a way for a while so I apologize for not gett=
ing back to these questions=20
sooner. I've noticed this topic seems to be less than responsive when you t=
ry to post to it.=20

((First, where does your interest in the (our) U.S. Constitution stem from?=
 Why do you think it is so vital=20
for us to read and understand it?))=20

After the war, the United States had split into five separate regions based=
 on the various factors and=20
military objectives they each had. There was a great deal of anger directed=
 toward the Federal government=20
and a revival of states rights was becoming paramount. However, in their at=
tempt to create an economic=20
form of government, the political and military leaders at the time decided =
to hold one last Constitutional=20
Congress in order to present a psychological cohesion from the old system. =
During this Congress, the=20
leaders discovered and decided that coming up with a new and better form of=
 government was nearly=20
impossible. The original Constitution itself was not the problem it was the=
 ignorance of the people that=20
lived under it.=20


116=20



((Second, do you not like your "new" Constitution? Or feel that it is not a=
s effective as the original?))=20

From my viewpoint, it's very effective. I am a very strong believer in loca=
l or state's rights.=20

((Third, you keep saying that you will be going back to your worldline soon=
, how soon will this be?))=20

There are certain windows I must wait for in order to leave. There will be =
two this year. The first one=20
opens this spring.=20

((Is it physically possible for you to get back to THIS time line once you =
leave?))=20

Not with the machine I have now.=20

((If all 7 Billion of us here each had our own time machine do you think th=
at would we would end up=20
trashing the rest of the local worldlines?))=20

Since everything is already happening and possible on different worldlines,=
 the answer is yes....and no.=20

((Correct me if I'm wrong here but I see you as a Libertarian who expounds =
on the need for humanity to get=20
back to certain basics. Like the issues defined by the Constitution and you=
r comments earlier on firearms=20
tend to make me believe you are a Gun Rights activist.))=20

I suppose from your vantage point that's a fair assessment. I would call my=
self more of a centrist.=20

Although I understand the "gun rights" issue here, I cannot relate to it al=
l and it is a common point of=20
argument with my mother. I keep saying her tune will change in about ten ye=
ars and she'll be cleaning=20
shotguns in her sleep but it doesn't help. If it makes you feel any better,=
 I never shot anyone who wasn't=20
trying to kill me.=20

((could you give us your thoughts on how us "less enlightened" ones here in=
 this worldline of the here/now=20
can solve the technical problems of time travel so that we may be able to e=
njoy the same first hand=20

if you had my machine? How do=20
you think the rest of the world would react to the U.S. having a time machi=
ne and they didn't?=20

((You said that you traveled back in time from 2036 to 1975 with a ~l-2% di=
vergence. You also mentioned=20
that in your time frame a 0% divergence is sort of a myth, i.e technologica=
lly improbable.))=20

Yes, a "ZD" is thought to be impossible. However, consider that an exact en=
try point "may" not be necessary=20
to get home. The important factor is the path, not the destination. Under m=
ultiple world theory, there are=20
an infinite number of "homes" that I could return to that don't have me the=
re. The divergence for that=20
window is somewhere near .0002377%.=20

((Someone correct me where I'm wrong here but as I understand it, these Par=
allel Universes or Alternative=20
Timelines are "created" by events in our own, (timelines) or even in others=
.))=20

Parallel universes exist independently of each other and only interact to a=
void the collapse of the wave=20
function for any given particle that you are looking at. I like to imagine =
it as a series of parallel=20
lines crossed by a sine wave. Each point on the sine wave where a line cros=
ses it represents an alternate=20
outcome. The multiple "yous" on each worldline record a different result fo=
r the activity of the particle=20
or event.=20

((Actually, in science, "Multiverse" theory is something that has NEVER bee=
n proven. For lack of evidence.=20

It crops up from time to time as a way to explain certain SEEMING paradoxes=

Mr. TT_0,=20

Let us assume you are a time traveller. I do not see any viable way for you=
 to return to your own time line=20
then. I say this because that you mentioned the difficulty with time travel=
 in the sense of divergences.=20
You said that you travelled back in time from 2036 to 1975 with a ~l-2% div=
ergence. You also mentioned=20
that in your time frame a 0% divergence is sort of a myth, i.e technologica=
lly improbable. Now if I=20
understand your plan, you say you will once again travel back to 1975 befor=
e you arrived and then go=20
forward as to avoid going into the future of our time line, which by your p=
resence here would be an=20
alternate future from your own. But what I would ask is, if you plan to go =
back to 1975 from 2000, you=20
should incur a certain non-zero percent divergence just as you did going fr=
om 2036 to 1975. I would=20
surmize that it is impossible or technologically improbable for you to go b=
ack to the exact world line you=20
departed from then. Even if you are able to travel back with a 0% divergenc=
e, which by your previous words=20
would be mythological, what would ensure you that the future you travelled =
into was exactly the world line=20
you left. Since there are an infinite number of possible world lines depart=
ing from 1975 into the future.=20

I suppose the key point of this argument is that any trip through time with=
 your technology would result=20
in a non-zero divergence, and in order for you to arrive in your own world =
line you must create a 0%=20
divergent trip. This is amusing in the sense that the harder you try to get=
 to your own world line the=20
more divergences you incur and hence the furthur away you get. I believe I =
see the birth of a new temporal=20
paradox.=20

Greetings everyone. I've been away for a while so I apologize for not getti=
ng back to these questions=20

sooner. Since Trott brought up a few things I had addressed in the mysterio=
us mail that never made it to=20
the board...I will post it here. The others are responses from other questi=
ons.=20

((First, where does your interest in the (our) U.S. Constitution stem from?=

If I understand TT_0 properly (which, I'm afraid, may be debatable)and if I=

risk an idea based on Trott's question to test my understanding:=20

If the potential divergens is approximately .00024%, then the difference be=
tween "adjacent" worldlines has=20
the highest probability to be negligible.=20

Assuming that, then a TT_0 from "the next worldline over" is likely to have=
 left to go on a similar mission=20
and will return to "the original" TT_0's worldline.=20

That is, the TT_0 we've obviously found so stimulating will return to a dif=
ferent worldline, surely, but it=20
would be so similar to his own, it might as well be his original.=20

Similarly, a TT_0 ("not ours") will return from a worldline similar to our =

Dear TTO,=20

That is interesting what you said about parallel universes having a time de=
lay. Infact just a couple of=20
days ago I came up with a very similar conclusion.=20

I believe that all mass quantities have both a linear fourth dimensional pa=
st and a transverse fourth=20
dimensional past. The parallel masses are masses existant in the parallel t=
ime frames.=20

I believe that an instant of time in the parallel universe&lt;or&gt; a 'tra=
nsverse' instant that is in phase with=20
any given instant in this universe is exactly or approxametly one instant i=
n the past with respect to the=20
instant in this universe and would appear (and I could be wrong about this =
assumption) to exist within the=20
same given space as negative one instant in this world line&lt;or&gt; one '=
linear' instant in the past.=20

However if we were viewing the travsverse instant from the position of the =
linear instant=E2=80=94that is=E2=80=94if we=20
were to view the parallel instant from one instant back in time, then the t=
ransverse instant would not=20
appear to coexist in the same space as our the instant that we occupy but, =
instead, would apear to=20
propagate perpindicalar-or-would be perpindicular to our position. This is =
all hypthetical not=20
theoretical.=20

I leave you with this graghical model for review, if one were to trace all =
linear instants along their past=20
world lines to the bigbang, and if one were to trace all transverse time in=
stants back to the big bang,=20
and then gragh these events, one would discover that all transverse time in=
stants are ninety degrees out=20
of phase with the linear time instants.=20

I believe that one would also discover that these time instants travel outw=
ard in the form of temperal=20
waves and that the bandwidth of these of both the transverse time instants =
and linear&lt;or&gt; parallel time=20
instant's bandwidth streches as time accelerates into the future as though =
time were exploding into an=20
expance.=20

I believe that the rate at which transverse and linears instant's bandwidth=
 increases simultaneous and=20
equal so that the phase differencial between all linear instants and thier =
parallel counterparts the=20

transverse instants has always been constant from the big bang till now. At=
 the big bang all linear=20

instants and all transverse instants merge.=20

Think or write the following graph to replicate the mathematical logic behi=
nd this phenomenon. Get a pieve=20
of paper and draw a right triangle. Make it so that the horizontal line poi=
nts to 3 O'clock and the=20

vertical line points to 12 O'clock. Now take the ruler or what ever straigh=
t object you used to draw the=20

triangle and draw a diagonal line from the intersection of the vertical lin=
e and horizontal line to 2=20
O'clock. Now I want you to measure the length of the vertical line and then=
 divide the length into=20
quarters and place a small mark on the vertical lines at each of the quarte=
rs. Now I want you to draw four=20
parallel lines through the four marks on the vertical line, such that there=
 is one line through each one=20
of the four marks on the vertical line of our triangle. Make sure that the =
four lines are horizontal with=20
respect to the line that marks the base of our right triangle. Now I want y=
ou to goe back and make sure=20
that the diagonal line that you drew is long enough to intersect each of th=
e four parallel lines you drew.=20
Now the parallel lines on the graph are time instants 1-4. The vertical and=
 horizontal line is a the=20
measure of a mass in three dimensional space. Now you will notice that each=
 of the four vertical lines=20
instants 1-4 intersect the diagonal line at the 1/3 mark so that each paral=
lel time line 1-4 is always=20
divided at the 2/3rds mark.=20

Yet if one looks closely enough one will notice that the vertical line of o=
ur triangle, the diagonal that=20
we drew, and the base of our triangle all intersect at a point.=20

Thus 2/3rds and l/3rd are equal quantities at an infinitely small point. If=
 the parallel time instants=20

follows after this mathematical topology then the transverse instants and t=
hier parallel counterparts all=20
exist out of phase thoughout history accept at the exact instant of the big=
 bang.=20

Thus if one can triangulate the temperal location of the big bang while in =
time warp the ship could travel=20
through temperal space to into the big bang and use the big bang to as sort=
 of an infinite amplifier to=20
solidify the and or isolate the location of ones exact world line and thus =
travel through time with zero=20
divergance.=20

Does any of this sound correct TTO?=20

please allow me to disclose an idea we toss around a bit in 2036. Since all=
 possibilities, outcomes and=20
events are occurring and exist simultaneously, it would mean there are mult=
iple universes out there where=20
'you' are living a day behind and a day ahead of the 'you' on this universe=
.=20

There are some who believe that memory is some sort of information transfer=
 or communication with the=20
'yous' in the past, across worldlines or universes. Although this is seemin=
gly quite ridiculous, if you=20
think that could be true, than physics tells us that the same information t=
ransfer from our future selves=20
on other worldlines is not only possible but certain.=20

Click to expand...=20

If you could occassionally communicate with the you's from different world =
lines (day ahead)(day behind)=20
would this explain the common dejavu people seem to have at times?=20

the definition of dejavu is as follows "which is described as the illusion =
of having previously=20
experienced something actually being encountered for the first time"=20
hmmm...this is very interesting indeed.=20

If this be true it could explain alot of other things as well such as an un=
explained bad feeling or=20
fear of not getting on a plane that you find out later crashes.=20

Is it possible to recieve messages from other world lines? if so how is it =
done?=20

rent, we have all heard the=20

Ok just for the fun of it let me add to the confusion by submitting another=
 theory. I THE GREAT SHADOW CAN=20
CONTROLL THE CREATION OF ALTERNATE WORLD LINES! How?=20

I sit down at the kitchen table and slide my coffee cup to the left one foo=
t. A second world line is=20

created that is exactly the same as the first .except the cup is in a diffe=
rent spot. Both lines are=20

so similar and close in time and space that the miraculous event goes un-no=
ticed and un-applauded.=20

Every event and object of a parallel world that does NOT differ from our pr=
esent one IS the present one and=20
is shared over time and space, with all the alternates. Only the difference=
s would be detectable and those=20
differences would be by definition elsewhere. We could have "parallel" worl=
ds by the zillions glued so=20
tight together as to be "too close to see".=20

In other words when I move the cup over to the left I am just moving the cu=
p to the left and not moving the=20
rest of the universe over to the right as is suggested in the multi univers=
e therory.=20

Your idea certainly seems to be a plausible hypothesis.=20

I may be oversimplifying the matter (or have missed a major point entirely)=
, but I can't help but wondering=20
about the physical ramifications of being even temporally present at the bi=
g bang.=20

That is, wouldn't being there at the time of the mother of all explosions b=
e a little difficult to survive?=20

Let me change gears in this post to present a slightly oddball idea:=20

I truly like the idea of slight temporal differences between worldlines. If=
 we take this concept a step=20
further, and looked further across (as opposed to "down") the worldlines, w=
e may see greater differences=20
in time. That is one worldline at our reference time 2:00pm would be at 3:0=
0pm at another worldline=20
further across this array of worldlines. The further across, the greater th=
e temporal difference.=20

That being said, we can state that all times exist simultaneously. Therefor=
e, time travel need not be a=20
linear event, but rather a "skipping over" of worldlines. Of course, it can=
 be agued that this would not=20
be a genuine form of time travel, merely an illusory one.=20

So...how could this be accomplished, folks? Any ideas?=20

I'm guessing a singularity of some sort may still be required. However, I t=
hink Pamela and others may have=20
really hit upon something with their ideas of deja-vu and other phenomenon.=

Hi TimeTravel_0=20

Trott has made a very good point there. If you leave your worldline, some o=
f your friends and familymembers=20
will never see you again on that worldline. Correct me if I'm wrong, but th=
at would be a very immoral=20
thing to do.=20

Besides what's the point of fixing the Unix problem if there's an infinite =
number of worldlines where this=20
problem doesn't even exist or has been fixed. After all your own worldline =
doesn't get the IBM 5100=20
anyway, so the people that sent you on this mission are still having that p=
roblem.=20

Also, you stated that "to the people on your worldline you'd only be gone f=
or a split second". This can't=20
be true, because to them you'll go away and never return.=20

Oh, I seem to have missed another statement by Trott saying that another "T=
imetravel_0" will return to the=20
worldline, but that sounds virtually impossible!=20

Timetravel_0 stated clearly that returning to your own worldline is thought=
 to be impossible. Besides if=20
something like that were to happen, it's very improbable that it would happ=
en to the worldline that=20
Timetravel_0 originated from.=20

Consequently, Timetravel_0's friends and family are left alone and will nev=

One of the reasons I like this board so much is that the questions are more=
 thought out, the people seem to=20
be a bit smarter than normal and I'm not continually bombarded with questio=
ns about stock tips. I will=20
admit that on a conceptual level, you are picking it up much faster than I =
did.=20

(If you leave your worldline, some of your friends and family members will =
never see you again on that=20
worldline. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that would be a very immoral thing =
to do.)=20

I'm not sure why you think it would be immoral. Don't soldiers today go on =
duties they may not return from?=20

It depends on how you define what the real 'me' is. If you consider the mir=
ror example again, as all of the=20
'mes' step one room to the right, the family and friends in that room (and =
the time traveler for that=20
matter) would not be able to tell the difference. The probability of us not=
icing a difference is based on=20
the divergence of the trip. If all events and outcomes are certain, there a=
re worldlines where I do return=20
for every worldline I don't return to. All the 'moral' events would then ba=
lance out to zero. Again, it's=20
hard to judge good and bad outcomes [only good and bad decisions.=20

((Besides what's the point of fixing the Unix problem if there's an infinit=

Our actions and decisions are based on the knowledge we have in our own wor=
ldline. Yes, the bell shaped=20
curve is a useful tool but if we are capable of change for the better than =
we feel we should at least try.=20
Even if 'I' don't return to my exact worldline, a similar 'me' probably wil=

id.=20

Questions for time travel _0. Are the Olympics still being played in your t=
ime? You said that you're the=20
VGL system records your trip, would it not be possible to use that recordin=
g to back track to your=20
original starting point without any divergence at all? It seems that all it=
 would take it is a couple=20
lines of programming in the computer-controlled system. It would just make =
your trip a little longer and=20
be more computer intensive. Or is this what the system does and because of =
the clocks you use, you can=20
only get so close to you're original world line. Have you ever read the boo=
k Six Nightmares by Anthony=20

Hi Timetravel_0,=20

Again, I do not have enough knowledge to completely understand all the cons=
equences of multiple worldlines.=20
And it is not my intention to prove or disprove that you're a timetraveler,=
 I just enjoy exploring all the=20
possibilities.=20

I see your point now. Another "you" that traveled back in time from another=
 worldline, might end up going=20
back to the worldline of which you originated, because of the divergance. H=
owever there's still a big=20
chance that Copy_of_Timetravel_0 will not return to your ZD worldline and t=
hus leaving your friends and=20
family without a copy of you.=20

You mentioned that the same goes for soldiers in our worldline. Yes, true. =
But do you not disaprove of war,=20
just like me? I think it's immoral so I stand with my previous statement.=
=20

Also, wanting to make things better is not a bad thing, but what's the use =
of bringing back an IBM 5100 to=20
a slightly different worldline, knowing that there are just as many or even=
 more worldlines in which no-=20
one returns to bring back the IBM 5100. It sounds a bit like charity in fav=

Yeah I'd CERTAINLY agree with you that there is no evidence to support the =
idea that multiple universes=20
CANNOT be so, just as there is evidence that they COULD be so, but as yet a=

The problem they present for me is purly logical, not based on anything I c=

Just as Time02112 has stated (if I interpret correctly,) my reference to fr=

whether I accept it or not. Point taken. But, I'm still left with having to=

Physics to me is perfectly logical in all things we know and understand so =

TTA:=20

What I like about TT_0 is his adherence to "character". Meaning that this i=
s first and foremost a board=20
devoted to Time Travel which at this point in our human history is pure fic=
tion.=20

Even the moderators and creators of this board are careful to point that ou=
t right on the home page at the=20
bottom. Lest we forget.=20

So... having said that, I must admit TT_0 has woven a personna that is rath=
er well crafted in my opinion.=20

In other words, I take him as he prefers to be referenced to. It's a "camp"=
 thing. A Tongue-in-cheek kinda=20
process.=20

I find his philosphical dissertations to be interesting, and for the most p=
art, reflective of an idealism=20
that indicate what shape he would LIKE to see the world BE in in 40 years. =
With a dose of caution thrown=20
in for what he sees as possible threats to further enlightenment, and the e=
rosion of personal freedoms=20
that are occuring around us on an almost daily basis. Actually quite creati=
ve on his part if we take it=20
all with the grain of salt that is apropos to the situation.=20

In the end, if Time Travel is to be solved, is it not goung to take creativ=
e thought to do it?=20

We've beaten the old concepts to death on this board for a few years now.=
=20

I merely suggest that ANY approach to the problem that deviates from these =
old concepts is a creative and=20
therefore productive one.=20

If TT_0 wants to assume the role of futirist-as-time-traveller, I say OK. B=
ut then I'm a pragmatic sort of=20
guy who is into the sceptism of "show me the money" mentality.=20

Is it possible to show how some of his mechanics cannot possibly be true? O=
f Course.=20

But is it possible to show how his philosophical approach is flawed? Well, =
that becomes another problem=20
entirely. Not one so easy to dismiss.=20

Hi Timetravel_0,=20

Your answers made perfect sense. However, I found another glitch in your "d=

It's true, if you're able to help someone, you should. By going back to 197=
5, an infinite number of other=20
worldlines emerge, just because of you coming to 1975. At least half of the=
m undoubtly has "a happy=20

Nice article.=20

Thanx.=20

I hope rgrunt sees this. I think it's along the same lines he's hypothesizi=
ng. At least his "energy=20
density" idea anyway.=20

rgrunt?=20

Guest (rgrunt)=20

Feb 5, 2001=20

Thanks for refering me to the article. It was very interesting. To answer t=
heir questions on why quarks=20
have a greater mass then electrons is because there is more energy compress=
ed to a small space which makes=20
up the quark.=20

This results in a higher energy density to the quarks and a smaller space-t=
ime density in the quarks. If my=20
theory is correct one can calculate the difference between the density of a=
 quark and an electron by=20
finding out how far one would have to pry a strong force apart before the s=
trong force would equal an=20
infinite density.=20

That radius corresponds to the energy density of an electron compressed to =
a piont. Thus to increase the=20
radius of a strong force gluon is to increase the energy density of the qua=
rks.=20

This energy density increase of the quarks results in a space-time density =
within the quarks equal to=20
l/e A 2. Now the energy density of an electron is measured by the density o=
f the gluons that mediate the=20
strongforce between the quarks within the electron.=20

Since quarks increase in energy density as they are pryed a part the space =
time density will decrease as=20
the quarks increase and the gravitational forces exerted by an electron wil=
l increase as the electron is=20
split apart.=20

This is because one of the unique properties of strong force is that strong=
 force increases in strength as=20
the strong force is pryed apart. The space-time density within the quarks i=
s much less then the space-time=20
density within the electron itself. This is because the gluon is much less =
dense energy wise then the=20
quarks themselves.=20

When one measures the energy mass of an electron one is actually measureing=
 the lattice of energy that=20
surrounds the quarks which is an intertwining of strong force glouns. Since=
 the gloun force is surounds=20
the electrons quark mass like a field and since the space-time density with=
in the eletrons inner quark=20
mass is much less then the space-time density within the strong force gloun=
 that surounds the electron,=20
the strength of the gravitational pull of the electron increases more then =
likely to infinity as one=20
approaches the center mass of an electron as a result of the decrease in sp=
ace-time density to zero at the=20
centermass of the electron at which the energy density is infinite.=20

This means that the outermost energy force field is less massive then the i=
nner parts of the electron as is=20
supported by the 'confusing' experiments.=20

There are two reasons that an electron does not crush as a result of infini=
te gravitational force at the=20
center of the electron. First it requires a greater then infinite force to =
crush a mass to beyond the=20
center mass of the object. And second. Time becomes reversed beyond the cen=
ter mass of eletron. Thus the=20
mass beyond the centermass of an electron is superluminal and mediated by t=
achyons.=20

Thus when a greater then infinite force is applied to crush the electron; o=
nce that force travels beyond=20
the center mass of the electron the direction of the work being done by the=
 force reverses. This causes an=20
Greater then infinite force deflecting back through the force as a result o=
f the negative time component=20
causing the electron to assume it's possitive mass form.=20

I even heard from Dr. Michio Kakuchttp://mkaku.org&gt; the other night, on =
the radio, he spoke of this, and=20
mentioned that it is a "Misnomer" to say that it is "Nothing" in the space =
between electrons &amp; atoms, that=20
in fact "Something" is actualy there! (electrons from the quantum vaccum of=
 space.) again we must first=20
get by this, and try to understand it more, as in relation to what is happe=

this to our advantage, and then perhaps we will better understand the plaus=

Your depictions of Quantum Particle Thoery are indeed formidible. You are p=
roving to be someone who has=20

I follow you on the hypothesis you offer except for one thing, but it is me=
rely a matter of semantic=20
definition I'm sure.=20

Could you elaborate on the term "space-time density". I know I questioned w=
hat you meant by "energy=20
density" earlier, but now I do see what YOU mean by that. Your explanation =
was informative.=20

Also, when you say:=20

"This results in a higher energy density to the quarks and a smaller space-=
time density in the quarks. If=20
my theory is correct one can calculate the difference between the density o=
f a quark and an electron by=20
finding out how far one would have to pry a strong force apart before the s=
trong force would equal an=20
infinite density."=20


133=20



I assume you mean counteract the strong force by prying the quarks apart, b=
ut why would not the strong=20
force at some measurable distance reach a "breaking point" if you will, thr=
u the action of this "prying",=20
rather than approach an infinite density?=20

Would we not instead have a condition of "Free-quarks" available to establi=
sh the existence of other=20
protons or neutrons say, providing other free quarks can be found in a simi=
lar state? Since it only takes=20
three quarks to constitute a proton or neutron, (depending on quark color c=

should be easy to do. No?=20

Dear Bob,=20

Thankyou for the knowlege. Is the electron composed or held together by str=
ong force glouns? In other=20
words, are electrons made up of strong force? Are electrons known to be sin=
gle entities not made up of any=20
smaller partcles(accept glouns if composed of strong force)? If the electro=
n is not made up of any strong=20
forces then is electrons made up of weak force? I based my ussumption that =
electrons were composed and=20
bound by quarks bound togetherby strong force glouns but based on you last =
transmission I am assuming that=20
electrons are made up of strong force glouns(since electrons are known to b=
e indivisible). Is my=20
ussumption about the electron's composition correct?=20

Deviper,=20

When I speak of space-time density I am assuming that energy occupying spac=
e is the same as space being=20
occupied by energy and also space occupying energy. I assume that space-tim=
e is a tangable substance. I=20
see space asa quantized closed entity. I allow that space can be open but f=
or the most part it is as=20
closed system. By doubling the volume of space in a given region the densit=
y of space in that region will=20
be squared( I think) just like if one were to double the volume of energy i=
n a given region the density of=20

that energy would be squared(I think) No I believe that they woud be cubed =
for we are measuring energy per=20

unit volume and not per unit square....=20

To double the volume of space time in a given region is to double the volum=
e to which the energy in that=20
region is occupying. Thus by doubling the volume of space the same volume o=
f energy occupying a greater=20

volume of space results in a decrease in the energies density. Now this can=
 be reversed to say that if one=20

doubles the volume of energy in a given space the space in that region of s=
pace will decrease in density=20
as a result of less area of space occupying the same region of energy. Sinc=
e the density of energy is=20
uniform the density of space relative to the density of energy will also be=
 uniform. Thus the space=20
decreases density uniformly as energy increases density uniformly within th=
e closed region.=20

Dear Deviper,=20

Yes According to modern theory as far as I know that it would take an infin=
ite amount of energy to pry=20
apart a hadron. Of course the way that this is stated is that it is impossi=
ble to pry apart hadrons.=20

This is speculative in that the scientists assume that no infinite amount o=
f energy could be generated.=20
However I beg to differ. The way my device will work is a fluke of the mach=
anical setup.=20

By torqueing the field one compressed the field at a perpendicular angle an=
d stretches the field at the=20
parallel angle. By stretching the field in a vertical direction while simul=
taneously compressing the field=20
in a horizontal angle the kenetic forces applied allow for the compression =
to be countered by the=20
stretching such that the distribution of the field that propogates parallel=
 is redistributed to propagate=20
perpindicular while simultaneously the portion of the magnetic field that p=
ropagates perpendicular is=20
redistributed to propagate parallel.=20

This creates a shearing force that reaches a critcal stage at the point tha=
t the field is constriced to=20
bear the topology of an hourglass at 180 degrees of torque. Torqueing beyon=
d this will pry a gap in the=20
field because greater then infinite(or the upper limit) energy is applied i=
n a given instant at a given=20
point allotting the necesary work ( in watts I think) to pry apart the hadr=
ons thus causing the splitting=20
of hadrons or better yet fission of energy releasing ungodly amounts of ene=
rgy.=20

Think of it like this when one splits a mass at the molecular level a small=
 explosion accurs. When one=20
splitts a mass at the nuclear level a very large explossion accurs. When on=
e splitts mass at the energy=20
level an even larger amount of energy will be released.=20

I DO follow you here, and I like the fact that you are willing to challenge=
 the conventional wisdom of=20
Quantum Theory.=20

(To me, challenging "Conventional Wisdom" on ANYTHING is the path to discov=
ery.)=20

Now I'm left with another question tho.=20

When you say:=20

"By stretching the field in a vertical direction while simultaneously compr=
essing the field in a horizontal=20
angle the kenetic forces applied allow for the compression to be countered =
by the stretching such that the=20
distribution of the field that propogates parallel is redistributed to prop=
agate perpindicular while=20
simultaneously the portion of the magnetic field that propagates perpendicu=
lar is redistributed to=20
propagate parallel."=20

I have to ask.=20

Isn't this trying to apply conventional (macrocosmic) physics to the microc=
osmic world? Haven't we seen=20
that such applications are not to be relied upon when dealing with Quanta?=
=20

I would not suggest that what YOU suggest can't be done, merely that the ve=
ry ability to apply such=20
principles at such a level does itself break down due to the inability to e=
ven measure the accuracy of=20
microcosmic events with macrocosmic technology. Is this not the very founda=
tion of why the Heisenberg=20
Principle renders such applications even unmeasurable, let alone do-able?=
=20

It seems to me that the laws of physics as we know them to be at the macroc=
osmic level only ever will allow=20
us to construct devices that can only ever react with the macrocosmic world=
.=20

The microcosmic world requires methods that are not necessarily applicable =
on the larger scale, and vice=20
versa.=20

In short, I'm not sure the principles of "perpendicular" and "parallel" hav=
e any real meaning at the=20
quantum level.=20

He has nothing to prove to us because he is a writer who is looking for som=
e interaction to help him=20
construct the characters in his story. I woudln't be surprised to see a sim=
ilar book or movie about this=20
soon.=20

I tested him by first saying i was a writer of science fiction. Notice how =
he chose to ignore my comments=20
and questions. I asked him again to tell us more about his observations of =
society... which he blatantly=20
avoided by saying "ask me questions".=20

Since he has such a deep-seeded hate and despair for this time period (we c=
aused the war he grew up with)=20

it would seem that he would be more outspoken about it (which he was before=
). Now he is running out of new=20

things to say, hoping that we will spark something new to finish off his no=
vel.=20

Explain these points:=20

-he suddenly does not want to talk about society.=20

-he had time to learn how to write perfect english while he was growing up =
fighting war and now running his=20
farm just to survive.=20

-before the election was decided, he said that the florida votes would neve=
r be counted. They were counted,=20
(don't tell me that his landing in the 1970's caused the election to change=
)=20

-his use of "Gosub" as a metaphore for something. During his time period he=
 would never have learned BASIC=20
and the langauge. Even if his grandfather taught him about it he would stil=
l not be so familiar with it=20
that he would use "Gosub" in a sentence not related to programming. Much mo=
re likely he grew up during the=20

1970's and is now in his mid 40's contemplating his life.=20

The point remains. His details are well thought out, but he doesn't have an=
ything to prove to us. He won't=20
respond to making a sound clip for us, which shows that he's not really int=
erested in changing our=20
timeline... a point which he has flipped back and forth on.=20

Now that we have cought on, and have not supplied interesting questions for=
 him to explain, he is=20
uninterested in us. A sign of selfishness, which by the way is the very tra=
it that he blames us for.=20

Greetings everyone! I've missed you all too. As I'm sure Pamela can tell yo=
u, my email system is made up of=20
quite a few addresses, locations and computers. Some of them work better th=
an others and for a period of=20
time, I have been unable (in my own way) to get to this site. It appears I'=
ve come back at just the right=20
moment.=20

I see you're all asking yourselves questions about who I really am, what I =
want and why I'm here. Frankly,=20

I really can't blame you but perhaps it's a bit easier now to understand wh=
y I not only didn't expect you=20
to believe me but I didn't want you to. As far as my credibility, I thought=
 we had reached some sort of=20
happy medium and we could call each other friend.=20

I see however that may not be the case and I must admit I'm a bit disappoin=
ted. It seems that unless I=20
follow your expectations of what a time traveler should be doing thinking o=
r feeling than I must be a=20
fraud. Or is it just safer to keep telling yourself that?=20

((im not paranoid(not too paranoid) but i think it was a terrible idea for =
TT0(if his story is true) to=20
have told us anything about it.))=20

Where was this setiment and concern for my safety as I was telling my 'stor=
y'?=20

((TT_0 was always saying he has nothing to prove to us..then WHY..WHY come =
to a TIME TRAVEL forum(and=20
numerous others) to spout off your achievements..))=20

Is it really that hard to believe that plain old human interaction has it's=
 own merits?=20

((I do not say this as a detriment to his words, (since I'm already on reco=
rd as considering him to be a=20
creative and intelligent person who has a lot to say philosophically), but =
merely that his declarations on=20
being a time traveler are based on quantum theories that have already been =
clearly proven to NOT be so.))=20
Which quantum theories are you talking about? Please forgive me but If I mi=
ssed a question or if there was=20
something else to go into I would have been happy to do so.=20

((Either way, it sure would be interesting to hear what kinds of stories yo=
u'd share with us next. I know=20
I'm anxious to hear them. How about you?))=20

TTA wants to hear more from me? Now there's a turn of events.=20

and Borgus, I'm not even sure where to start. Please. Tell me how you reall=
y feel.=20

In retrospect, you do force me to examine whether or not talking like this =
was a good idea. I still think=20
it was.=20

I have been over to Art Bells board and really don't see any thing there th=

here, seems the same to me with some extra things.=20

Being skeptical is one thing... blaming and accusing is another.=20

I wouldnt blame him if he didnt want to post here anymore.=20

Borgus-you say he is uninterested in us. but he did supply a bunch of quest=
ions to us that only THREE=20
people out of this whole board even answered! he wanted to know very much h=
ow you felt about these things=20
but none of you answered him. yet., you expected him to continue to answer =
YOUR questions,=20
thats not give and take..thats just all take,=20
and THAT my friend, is selfish.=20

I don't know if he is really a Time traveler or not. I have seen more and k=
now more than all of you about=20
this, which makes my decision harder.=20

I have considered all things... I am skeptical but I am also keeping all th=
ings in mind.Alot of good points=20
were brought up on both sides.=20

I have decided skeptism is healthy for everyone.=20

 be treated with respect as a=20
human being, timetraveler or not.=20

Dear Deviper,=20

This is quite possible. However I am basing my physics on the apparent natu=
re of light as focused through a=20
convex lense.=20

The focusing light through a convex lense we increase the number of thermal=
 photons at a given space of=20
focus thus increasing the temperature.=20

It is unconventional to try to focus sun light to a singularity which would=
 increase the temperature to=20
infinity on account that it would require on infinitly large convex lense.=
=20

However a magnetic field if focused to a singularity would increases to inf=
inity as the energy density of=20
the field increases to infinite as the field is focused to a singularity.=
=20

This enables an infinite electrical output.=20

My basis is that by compressing one part of the magnetic field the other pa=
rt stretches like the magnetic=20
field were a fabric.=20

This is all macro-physical in nature but built of micro-physical entities.=
=20

By stretching molecular entities or atomic entities horizontally one decrea=
ses the energy density=20
vertically by increasing the space-time density horizontally. This results =
in the compression of space on=20
a horizontal level and a decompression of energy on the horizontal line.=20

The energy density on the vertical level remaining the same gravitates to o=
ccupy the space-time within=20
horizontal line which is why when one stretches a rubber band the molucules=
 along the horizontal axis=20
expands to the left and right while the molecules that are along the vertic=
al axis of the rubber band=20
gravitate toward the center of the band thus making the rubber band thinner=
.=20

There is more to this mathematically. For the density to space-time ratio f=
or vertical measure is unchanged=20
by the expansion of the rubber band along the horizontal axis.=20

The expansion of the band along the horizontal axis results in the relative=
 increase of the density of=20
space which reestablishes the definition of the borders of the quantity of =
rubber along the horizontal=20
axis which changes the numbers in the equation S=3Dl/e A 2 for the horizont=
al axis in such a manner as to=20
acentuate the decrease in relative size of the length of the band verticall=
y by the increase in length of=20
the rubber band.=20

So although the density of the rubber band along the vertical axis does not=
 change,that is, the overall=20
density ratio S=3Dl/e A 2 for the vertical length of the band does not chan=
ge but is lesser when campared with=20
the density ratio S=3Dl/e A 2 for the horizontal plane.=20

This explains why the density of a rubber band or any quantum material does=
 not increase along the vertical=20
length when stretched along the horizontal length. Sh=3Dl/e A 2, h=3D2 for =
horizontal. Sv=3Dl/e A 2, v=3D2 for=20
vertical, (this is the mathematical representation for a circle using my ne=
w theory).=20

I appologize I will have to finish this later on acount that I have run out=
 of time.=20

Take care,=20

Ahhh.=20

It appears you are coming around to the classic "Double Slit" experiment. (=
Please correct me if I am=20
wrong.)=20

In the original, the patterns produced on a projection surface originating =
from a single light source and=20
subsequently passed through two verticle slits produces an interference pat=
tern on that same projection=20
surface that was not easy to explain to the first observers if this phenome=
na.=20

It became even more seemingly paradoxical when polarized lenses were applie=
d in 90 degree out of phase=20
configuration much in the same manner we use the same configuration to reso=
lve 3-D images on the motion=20
picture screen. (But of course 3-D film is constructed this way in the firs=
t place so we can use this=20
method to resolve it. (Eqrly-mid 20th century Technology, circa 1939 or so.=
)=20

Again, please correct me if I'm wrong.=20

I haven't been following your previous exchanges too closely, but it seems =
that you two don't get on.=20
Whether it has been in an argument over a theory or someone has insulted so=
meone, we have had these=20
incidents before and we won't stand for them. If you can't all play nicely,=
 someone's gonna get themselvea=20

 grow a community that is a=20

tles in posts we will become=20

Feel free to argue with ideas, but please, keep personal feelings to yourse=
lf (hostile ones anyway). If you=20

n't waste other people's and my=20

It's obvious we were going to get people posting on the board claiming to b=
e "time travellers" or claiming=20
to have esoteric knowledge and not being prepared to tell anyone else.=20

It's nice to think a pioneer of time travel would grace our board, and who =
knows - maybe he/she has.=20

But one thing for sure. The typicality of coming on here and saying: "I'm a=
 time traveller", "I know=20
something you don't know" bla bla bla - is the thing a genuine time travell=
er would do.=20

In my opinion, time trave would be used for tactical and extremely classifi=
ed research, possibly in lots of=20
different forms, and revealing oneself would probably cause destruction of =
the research aims.=20

Anyway, as to TTA/Enforcer and TT_0, you two obviously have some civil disp=

Dear Deviper,=20

I have heard of the EPR paradox before. But I am not sure if my memory serv=
es. Is the EPR paradox the=20
paradox that seems to insist that particles are both waves and particals? D=
oes the EPR paradox suggest=20
partical wave duality. If the EPR paradox is partical wave duality then yes=
 I believe that I may be on the=20
track to solving this phenomenon or on the track to making a big scientific=
 error. Either case will=20
provide knowlege for future theorists to guide them unto more accurate trut=
h. So if I am right then great=20
but if not then perhaps someone else can take my knowlege and correct it an=
d discover the truth. I believe=20
that I will be able to provide alot more accurate knowlege through experime=
ntation and measurement.=20

Perhaps this will be done by physisists using my device or by myself in a l=
ab of myown should I be lucky=20

enough to abtain this. I believe that the conscept will help describe the p=
artical both as a wave and as a=20

partical in that it describes the mathematical relation of the partical in =
terms of space and energy=20

density. An electron of low energy would appear to look like a clowd as a r=
esult of the energy occupying a=20

greater density of space (which appears to have more volume) and an electro=
n of high energy interactions=20
would appear to be pointlike as a result of the energy occupying a lower de=
nsity of space( which appears=20
to have less volume).=20

Does this sound like a possible solution to the EPR paradox?=20

Yes I think originally the wave vs. particle dispute was fueld by this seem=
ing "paradox" but if memory=20
serves me correctly, it has now become an issue of our inability to determi=
ned the time interval between=20
cause and effect, i.e. the so called inability we suffer from to be able to=
 measure acurately at the=20
quantum level. The Heisenberg Principle if you will. The polarized double s=
lit experiment produces results=20
that for a while led some to speculate that events were occurring SIMULTANE=
OUSLY in two places at once.=20
This led to Wave Collapse Theory which Einstein called a "Spooky force at a=
 distance" and never really=20
bought into it as I recall.=20

Guest (rgrunt)=20

Feb 17, 2001=20

Yes I believe that is the theory the topic that we are discussing. I am awa=
re of the limitations of our=20

technology and it is a good question as to wheather or not it is the measur=
ing equipment that produces the=20
affect(paradox) or if the particle is truelly in the form of a wave and som=
etimes in the form of a=20
particle.=20

However to me the energy density verses space-time density is merely a simp=
le coscept of one kind of energy=20
occupying energy in the form of a container(space). A simple visual aid to =
help assist in visualizing the=20
conscept that I am suggesting is to take a single piece of string and tie t=
he ends together so that you=20
have a loop. Now take the loop of string and make a one-half twist so that =
you have a figure eight.=20

Now hold the figure eight out in front of you so that the figure eight look=
s like the infinity symbal. Let=20
the loop that is pointing to your right represent energy and it's density, =
let the loop that is pointing=20
to the your left represent the density and quantity of space-time that is o=
ccupied by the energy.=20

Now if you increase the radius of the right loop-which symbolizes the energ=
y the left loop will decrease in=20
size and density. If you make the right loop twice it's original size the l=
eft loop representing space=20
will shrink to half it's size.=20

This is the conscept that I am suggesting is accuring with electrons and al=
l energy and mass. Energy=20
occupies space such that when you increase the density of energy the partic=
al absorbs energy from the=20
space that it occupies thus decreasing the density and space that the parti=
cal of energy occupies through=20
displacement.=20

This results in a decrease in the radius of the partical as a result that t=
he particle has more quatity=20
gained from the vacuum of space and has a smaller radius and thus a greater=
 density.=20

I would say that the the majority and most likely all the extra density gai=
ned by and electron of high=20
energy interaction would be absorbed solely from the space-time that the en=
ergy occupies resulting in a=20
low space-time pressure intertial hole in the within the quantum matter mak=
ing up the electrons energy.=20

I would say that there would be a low pressure region of space-time around =
the electron itself caused by=20
the space-time of high density surrounding the electron gravitating towards=
 the intertial hole created by=20
the displacement of space-time quantity into electron density.=20

So I believe that the electron does not absorb energy from the surounding s=
pace-time quantity to create the=20
gravitational field surrounding the electron but absorbs the space-time qua=
ntity from into energy to add=20
density to the electron during high energy interactions only from the space=
-time that the electron=20
occupies and that the gravitational field surrounding the electron is cause=
d by the space around the=20
electron to gravitate towards the intertial hole or low space-time pressure=
 within the area that the=20
electron is localized.=20

This, in my oppinion, is a static system and that the space-time does not f=
low into the electron from=20
outside the electron but creates a static flow into the electron.=20

An easy visual aid to observe this kind of phenomenon is to observe the spi=
nning candy cain pole at your=20
local barber shop. Notice that the red and white spirals(helixes) do not ac=
tually move up to the top of=20
the cylindrical cain but the rotation of the cylinder makes it appear as th=
ough the red and white spirals=20
move toward the top of the candy cain pole.=20

The helix of the spinning candy pole can represent the space-time in the fo=
rm of helixical waves spiraling=20
towards the electron mass of low space-time density as a result of the cent=
ripital(or centrifical)=20
forces(I am always getting these two confused) at work within the electron.=
=20

It is sort of like the whirl wind created in a blender. The water does not =
flow through the bottom of the=20
blender but all the blobs of chocolate mix is carried by the water toward t=
he blades of the blender. The=20
low pressure created by the spinning blades combined with the torque of the=
 blades creates the static=20
whirl wind affect which is quite similar to the dynamic whirl wind affect c=
reated by the water draining in=20
your toilet when you flush it.=20

The space time quantity is laiden with all kinds of waves fields of space-t=
ime quantity but when the low=20
pressure space-time is created by the presence of dense energy the space-ti=
me waves of high pressure=20
gravitate towards the space-time of low pressure creating the spin affect o=
f the space-time waves and=20
fields. This process creates a dynamical flow of energy in the form of ener=
gy or mass(not space) toward=20
the region of low space-time density in the same way that the nestles quik =
is carried on the milk that is=20
spinning in the blender toward the low pressure milk at the surface of the =
blender blades.=20

What I mean by "the energy and mass are dynamic and space is not" is merely=
 that the chocalate coco moves=20
toward the blades of the blender but the milk itself as a whole does moves =
very little towards the blades=20
of the blender if at all.=20

Gosub is considered a "swear word" in the programming world. But it's used =
by the ameteurs. It is bad=20
practive to use something like that in Java, C, C++, you never want to brea=
k out of a loop like that.=20
However is can be used. It is there for emergencies, when you are stuck and=

Gosub is not so much a swear word at all since it implies the return linkag=
e of the subroutine (the "sub"=20
part) you are "going" to.=20

It's "GoTo" thats become passe and no longer used.=20

The equalivent "verb" or "control" statement to Gosub in COBOL is "Perform"=
.=20
xBased languages use "Do" in calling a closed subroutine.=20


145=20


In Java and C++ which are Objected Oriented Development platforms, the term=
 or it's equilavent is moot=20
since the very technique itself is superceded by invoking instances of Clas=
ses.=20

But at the pure machine code level after it's been compiled, the action is =
controlled by the the same=20
concept.=20

Object orientation is a conceptual paradigm, at the source code level, just=
 as "Top Down Modular" was when=20
"Gosub" was a common practice.=20

GoTo was merely the first control statement that was used for branching. As=
 computers themselves became=20
more sophisticated and powerful, automatic return linkage was built into th=
e source code languages that=20
forced the compiler to automatically return to the next statement after Gos=
ub when the subroutine had=20
completed firing.=20

Thus eliminating the "spaghetti" logic of "goto" code.=20

But all the dicipline of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) still doesn't ke=
ep some people from writing=20
really crummy code.=20

Deviper and Wanderingsoul,=20

Thankyou for the high marks but I have no formal education in quantum physi=
cs. To tell you the truth I have=20
not even read a full book on any technical subject. I often go through elec=
tronics books and physics books=20
of various topics and skim them for knowlege that I have not gained. I am t=
ruelly as much an ametuer as=20
anyone else here.=20

I have read a little on the subject of quantum physics but there is a lot t=
hat I do not know.=20

This is why I come here humbly to share my hypothesesis with others on this=
 forum. I also consult formally=20
educated physisists.=20

One reason I like confering on this forum is the fact that it is filled wit=
h all manners of peoples of=20
different backgrounds and various points of views. Most of us are open mind=
ed in some respects and others=20
are closed in some reaspects. All of this is valuable I believe if these tr=
aits are put together properly.=20
I have noted that Einstein came up with his theories in 1901 and 1905 this =
is before he went to college. Am=20
I correct on this?=20

One other point to make is that many of the cool gadjets and theories that =
were created were done by those=20
who were not formally educated which might have been one reason they were o=
pen minded.=20

Einstein was both a closed and open minded person it seems. And many open m=
inds had to single handedly=20
accomplished a great deal for technology during thier lives over a hundred =
years ago do to the fact that=20
comunications between long distances was not as practical then as it is tod=
ay.=20

Here on this forum I see there are hundreds of posts from many people with =
open minds able to comunicate=20
with the whole world with nothing more then a key board, a telephone jack, =
and a computer. The point being=20
that we can more then likely accomplish leaps and bounds more then the open=
 minds a hundred years ago=20
because comunication for us is much more palitable; not because we are any =
smarter then they were back=20

I've often thought of this as a matter of fact.=20

Here is one for you....=20

evolved and developed into a higher species, and then developed time travel=

you could probably take that a step further and try to imagine what a speci=

While it does indeed seem that the velociraptor was quite intelligent, (as =
evidenced by it's=20
proportionately sized brain cavity found in the fossil remains,) I would wa=

As to the 5 million years "from there" in the "present timeline", I'd have =
to say you are off by about 55=20
or 60 million years.=20

The Chimpanzee is not radically older in evolutionary time than is man. The=

insight from someone who has supposedly "been there done that", so I will s=
et aside my human urge to judge=20
you, and see were this goes. So - I'd like to ask you a few questions.=20

1) I saw on another page of this board that you are from 2036, and still us=
e batteries and solar cells, why=20
do you still use batteries, when such great men (thats my faith talking) su=
ch as Tom Bearden and the=20
former Floyd Sweet and Bruce Depalma, have possibly made great strides in t=
he areas of free energy. What=20
happened to limit the success, and widespread distribution and developement=
 of these discoveries?=20

2) have your scientists found a link between consciousness and reality?=20

3) Is light speed as you understand it simply the capacitive reactance of o=
ur spacetime/quantum vacuum?=20

4) I'm gonna throw my idea of how a time machine works out there, and it wo=
uld be cool if you could key me=20
in on how far I am from your truth:=20

A time machine in my book, is slightly like a teleportation device. It zero=
es in on a specified pattern of=20
quantum states (like the quantum states of the particles involved during a =
significant event) and then=20
reconstructs the coinciding reality. This is because reality is possibly a =
hologram, related to the wave=20
interactions at the virtual (fundamental) particle/wave level, and if you l=
ook at a small portion of a=20
holographic plate the entire image will be on that section as well as the w=
hole plate, just with a lower=20
intensity. The quantum patterns duplicated by the time machine will be inte=
rpolated to form a complete=20
reality. Now, the time machine records and impresses your quantum imprint o=
n the resulting reality,=20
causing virtual particle/wave interactions to form your resulting physical =
body. The virtual state of a=20
particle, is possibly just the period in its life where it does not interac=
t with the surrounding=20
environment. A virtual particle does not exist in time, which is the reason=
 it can become virtual in the=20
first place. A virtual entity lends itself to the creation of time however,=
 in that its interactions with=20
other particles gives rise to the property of time. When one virtual partic=
le exchanges its information=20
with another virtual particle, a real particle results (one that is measura=
ble - actually the mere process=20
of measurement creates a real particle because of the unescapable exchange =
of info between what is assumed=20
to exist (the virtual particle that will soon become half of the observed e=
ntity), and the virtual=20
particles that confirm that asumption by interacting with the inferred part=
icle). The concept that a=20
fundmental particle has a virtual state is where the possibility of time tr=
avel comes into play. Actually,=20
what is actually happening is inter-reality travel. There are an infinite a=
mount of virtual particles=20
(because they can not be observed) so they constitute the realm of possibil=
ity. Any and every potential=20
transfer of energy takes place out of the virtual particle flux, because of=
 its zero/infinite existence in=20
time. Therefore, when one decision/observation is made, a whole new univers=
e is started. This happens in=20
jumps, due to the interactions of virtual particles. At any given instant, =
however, consciousness (the=20
mediator/observer of particle interaction) can only see/exist in its own un=
iverse, but the potential for=20
its existence in others as a parallel entity is infinite. I'm starting to r=
un out of time, so I'll quickly=20
sum it up. We now have the mehanism for time travel and teleportation - the=
y are extremely similar, but=20
instead of materializing something in its own time, another time is chosen,=
 each time a travel is made,=20
you make a reality jump to a different "world line". You would not be able =
to return to your exact world=20
line, but to one so close, it could still be considered your world line. Yo=
u would have left in a time=20
machine in that world line (your parallel you), and Upon your expected arri=
val, the first "you" that left=20
would be replaced by "you", on time, as expected.=20

Dear Trott,=20

What do think about the following theory that I posted to expain how gravit=

e if it sounds like the theory=20
might have any grounds(that is if the theory might have some accuracy to it=

 (if it won't be too=20
inconvenient for you, I know you are probably busy and I appreciate you tak=
ing the time to look in on this=20
forum from time to time.)=20

I look forward to learning from your next reply. I might add..will you do m=
e a favor and even if you think=20
the theory might be correct will you prove it wrong for me. If you prove it=
 wrong I will be able to have a=20
much deeper grasp on the conscepts that I am theorizing on because you will=
 be hitting on point's that I=20
have neglected or overlooked which will give me more knowlege to correct my=
 theory( actually everone's=20
theory who works on it).=20

I really appreciate it.=20

If you want to send lot's of technical information please fill free to do s=
o. I ask that you write in what=20
ever manner you are used to and not to worry about trying to explain it in =
terms that I would not=20
understand.=20

If I get confused I will look up words, phrases, or conscepts that you jott=
 down that I do not understand=20
and will learn about them. This will help me develop a stronger vocabulary =
with which to comunicate more=20
intelligably to the scientific comunity. Thankyou for your time.=20

here is the post:=20


I am aware of the limitations of our measuring technology and it is a good =
question as to wheather or not=20
it is the measuring equipment that produces the affect(paradox) or if the p=
article is truelly in the form=20
of a wave and sometimes in the form of a particle.=20

However to me, it seems that the energy density verses space-time density i=
s merely a simple coscept of one=20
kind of energy occupying energy in the form of a container(space). A simple=
 visual aid to help assist in=20
visualizing the conscept that I am suggesting is to take a single piece of =
string and tie the ends=20
together so that you have a loop. Now take the loop of string and make a on=
e-half twist so that you have a=20
figure eight.=20

Now hold the figure eight out in front of you so that the figure eight look=
s like the infinity symbal. Let=20
the loop that is pointing to your right represent energy and it's density, =
let the loop that is pointing=20
to the your left represent the density and quantity of space-time that is o=
ccupied by the energy.=20

Now if you increase the radius of the right loop-which symbolizes the energ=
y the left loop will decrease in=20
size and density. If you make the right loop twice it's original size the l=
eft loop representing space=20
will shrink to half it's size.=20

This is the conscept that I am suggesting is securing with electrons and al=
l energy and mass. Energy=20
occupies space such that when you increase the density of energy the partic=
al absorbs energy from the=20
space that it occupies thus decreasing the density and space that the parti=
cal of energy occupies through=20
displacement.=20

This results in a decrease in the radius of the partical as a result that t=
he particle has more quatity=20
gained from the vacuum of space and has a smaller radius and thus a greater=
 density.=20

I would say that the the majority and most likely all the extra density gai=
ned by and electron of high=20
energy interaction would be absorbed solely from the space-time that the en=
ergy occupies resulting in a=20
low space-time pressure intertial hole in the within the quantum matter mak=
ing up the electrons energy.=20

I would say that there would be a low pressure region of space-time around =
the electron itself caused by=20
the space-time of high density surrounding the electron gravitating towards=
 the intertial hole created by=20
the displacement of space-time quantity into electron density.=20

So I believe that the electron does not absorb energy from the surounding s=
pace-time quantity to create the=20
gravitational field surrounding the electron but absorbs the space-time qua=
ntity from into energy to add=20
density to the electron during high energy interactions only from the space=
-time that the electron=20
occupies and that the gravitational field surrounding the electron is cause=
d by the space around the=20
electron to gravitate towards the intertial hole or low space-time pressure=
 within the area that the=20
electron is localized.=20

This, in my oppinion, is a static system and that the space-time does not f=
low into the electron from=20
outside the electron but creates a static flow into the electron.=20

An easy visual aid to observe this kind of phenomenon is to observe the spi=
nning candy cain pole at your=20
local barber shop. Notice that the red and white spirals(helixes) do not ac=
tually move up to the top of=20
the cylindrical cain but the rotation of the cylinder makes it appear as th=
ough the red and white spirals=20
move toward the top of the candy cain pole.=20

The helix of the spinning candy pole can represent the space-time in the fo=
rm of helixical waves spiraling=20
towards the electron mass of low space-time density as a result of the cent=
ripital(or centrifical)=20
forces(I am always getting these two confused) at work within the electron.=
=20

It is sort of like the whirl wind created in a blender. The water does not =
flow through the bottom of the=20
blender but all the blobs of chocolate mix is carried by the water toward t=
he blades of the blender. The=20
low pressure created by the spinning blades combined with the torque of the=
 blades creates the static=20
whirl wind affect which is quite similar to the dynamic whirl wind affect c=
reated by the water draining in=20
your toilet when you flush it.=20

The space time quantity is laiden with all kinds of waves fields of space-t=
ime quantity but when the low=20
pressure space-time is created by the presence of dense energy the space-ti=
me waves of high pressure=20
gravitate towards the space-time of low pressure creating the spin affect o=
f the space-time waves and=20
fields. This process creates a dynamical flow of energy in the form of ener=
gy or mass(not space) toward=20
the region of low space-time density in the same way that the nestles quik =
is carried on the milk that is=20
spinning in the blender toward the low pressure milk at the surface of the =
blender blades.=20

What I mean by "the energy and mass are dynamic and space is not" is merely=
 that the chocalate coco moves=20
toward the blades of the blender but the milk itself as a whole does moves =
very little towards the blades=20
of the blender if at all.=20

our argument as to my point was=20
not sufficient. You suggested that an alternate you would most likely retur=
n to your world line. It just=20
does not seem logical for one to go back in time on a mission for their wor=
ld line only to return to an=20
alternate worldline where the mission goal may or may not have bearing if c=
ompleted.=20

By the way, the Kerr ring singularity is a spacetime possessing CLOSED time=
like curves. You would clearly=20
need a naked singularity so that the chronology violating region would not =
be hidden behind the event=20
horizon. This places limits on the size of the ring of the singularity, i.e=
. radius]Mass, using=20
geometrized units.=20

Perhaps, I have mistaken your backgrounds. If anyone can provide a proof to=
 this, I will share what I know=20
on the subject:=20

If a spacetime contains a causality-violating time machine, but does not co=
ntain a chronology-violating=20
time machine, then the only closed causal curves in the spacetime are close=
d null geodesics.=20

As you are aware, approaching a rotating singularity can be done quite easi=

Mr. Grunt, it seems to make sense to me. maybe an electron is a standing lo=
w-pressure wave of spacetime.=20
What if spacetime itself could be modeled as a random flux of particles? wh=
en these particles are ordered,=20
energy appears out of the "vacuum". Now, what if an electron where just a s=
tanding wave of negative energy=20
density, set into motion by a disturbance in the randomness of the vacuum? =
A statistical change in the=20
amount of order at a central location sets a ripple in spacetime into motio=
n. This ripple is one half of=20
an electromagnetic wave. This wave spreads out as na energy density wave, a=
nd can be seen as longitudinal=20
in nature. It then hits spots of more and less dense spacetime (level of pa=
rticle order) and parts of it=20
get reflected back in on itself, as a converging energy-density front, towa=
rds its origin. We now have a=20
time reversed wave, bringng energy back instead of giving it off. This happ=
ens at an incredible rate, and=20
is possibly what sustains the reaction, now we have a standing wave, and at=
 1/2 wavelength away from the=20
origin, a low pressure buildup might possibly occur. We have a particle wit=
h a one wavelength diameter,=20
with an electric field surrounding it. the electric field is the phase shif=
t of the two interacting wave=20
fronts, moving outward from the origin.=20

Hello. It seems that your name and the anagram for John Titor is simply a c=
oincidence.=20

I've posed this scenario to John as a strong argument against time travel. =
I received a sophisticated and=20
humorous response from him, which I appreciated. But he didn't attempt to e=
xplain hiw it could happen or=20
what prevents it from happening...=20

We tend to talk about time travel in terms of going forward or back in time=
 a number of years, decades or=20
centuries. But what of a small trip? A trip of 10 seconds with only a small=
 (several feet) change in=20
physical location.=20

A proposito:=20

The early time travel researcher plans a 10 second trip into the past where=
 he will be physically displaced=20
several feet from his original location. He has the experiment set to go. 1=
0 seconds before he throws the=20
switch his duplicate appears in the lab several feet from him.=20

Intrigued by his apparent success-to-be he enters into a discussion with th=
e duplicate. He learns the=20
following: the duplicate remembers entering his machine and throwing the sw=
itch - he also remembers seeing=20
a duplicate of himself appear in the lab 10 seconds before throwing the swi=
tch.=20

The "original" researcher declares success and never does enter his machine=
 and throw the switch. He=20
concludes that by simply building a viable machine and thinking about a tim=
e trip he has caused the=20
duplicate to appear.=20

If time travel is possible then this absurd failure of causality and chrono=
logy is also possible.=20

The absurdity is worse if you consider that it would appear that there is a=
n endless chain of duplicates=20
entering machines and seeing another endless chain of duplicates arriving a=
t the lab 10 seconds prior to=20
the throwing of the switch. What is the result of the endless chain of dupl=
icates arriving in the lab=20
simultaneously? If they arrive at, and simultaneously occupy, the same 4-di=
mensional coordinate they=20
violate exclusion. I'm aware of but one construct that can have that proper=
ty (of violating=20
exclusion) ... and it would be naked unless the duplicates were drunk and s=
pinning.=20

Using John's estimate of 2.5% divergence on a 60 year trip, I don't see div=
ergence as being a factor in a=20
10 second trip. These duplicates wouldn't be appearing on alternate timelin=
es.=20

Dear Richerl8,=20

I do not want to be hasty in making any oppinions but what you stated from =

Dear Fellow Time Travelers:=20

In about 30 days, I will be leaving this worldline to return home to 2036. =
I first want to say thank you=20
for the wonderful conversation and insight into your society. I have learne=
d a great deal and my opinion=20

I will finish the questions that have been posted on this site up to this d=

ry much. I do however want to=20
repeat my offer and add a slight twist.=20

After going over my flight plan home, I have discovered my VGL holdover per=
iod is a bit longer than I=20
expected. I will be spending at least three weeks in April of 1998 as I mak=
e my way back to 1975.=20
Therefore, I not only offer you the chance to leave a message to yourself i=
n 2036 but I offer you the=20
chance to leave yourself a message in 1998. I will take any compiled messag=
es and email addressees you=20
provide and send them on the net when I get to 1998.=20

Granted, this will not affect you on your worldline now but you make take s=
ome comfort that another 'you'=20
on another worldline has the advantage of knowing something you wish you kn=
ew three years ago. Based on=20
the earlier questions I've seen, I've decided a day-to-day record of the Do=
w a day in advance should=20
convince you that the messages are real in 1998.=20

In addition, I am hopeful a series of photocopies and photographs will be a=
vailable for you that may give=20
you more insight into the technology of the distortion unit. I will let you=
 know the address of the site=20
when it is available. I also plan to have my parents videotape my departure=
. If they succeed, it will also=20

I am not sure what you mean by unstable or stable when it comes to a singul=
arity. I asked before if this=20
was suppose to be a naked singularity or one which in fact has an event hor=
izon? If it does have an event=20
horizon, then Hawking radiation is a natural phenonmenon which you can not =
prevent, it is the result of=20
virtual particle pairs form at the event horizon something which can not be=
 prevented. Darby is correct to=20
point out that the evaporation rate is inversely related to the surface are=
a of the event horizon, so if=20
you have such a small black hole it should not last long at all before it e=
vaporates.=20

The mass an object has presumably comes from the coupling of its particles =
to the Higgs field. If you were=20
some how able to increase the coupling of a particle then you in theory you=
 could make it more massive. Or=20
if you were able to decrease the coupling make it less massive. Although, c=

investigating the situation I went back and read some pages and noticed tha=

and my postings are right next to each other now.=20

so in conclusion when someone deleted those postings (and several others)it=

up right away. Now I gotta tell you that I didn't remember acually seeing t=

"final proof" of anything tho. (Other than a long since non-registered '57 =

TT_0's photos look like he used one of the bucket seats from said '57 chevy=
 to build his "Time machine"=20
tho. That and a few old leftover calibration gauge units from 60's Aerospac=

Photons are bosons, having no electric charge or rest mass. They are the ca=
rriers of the electromagnetic=20
field. If only at absolute zero the inertial and gravitational forces are u=
nified as believed by some=20
researchers, then a simulation of the absolute zero condition may be possib=
le. EM standing wave=20
confinement of a symmetrical resonance state should approximate the require=
d conditions at temperatures=20
well above the absolute zero point. The approximation could result in a typ=
e of inertia we don't normally=20
encounter. Provided that a standing wave confinement condition is achieved =
for a time sufficient to be=20
measured. A standing wave appears to be stationary hence the term standing =
wave. It is this condition that=20
should approximate a frozen in time state. Just how this type of inertia re=
acts or interact with the ZPF=20
will provide possible new insights. The above model is a suggestion of this=
 idea.=20

The subatomic proton and neutron are both believed made from three quarks. =
Could this design be a MACRO=20
proton or antiproton? Since gravity fields act on and in proportion to the =
fundamental structures of=20
matter, what if that basic structure became huge? If we could then freeze t=
he resonance of that=20
particle would it act strangely? Would it have an inertia or gravitational =
effect?=20

We have found that when an object is forced to accelerate, it will see the =
ZPF to be asymmetric, or in=20
other words, distorted. Due to this distortion the accelerating object will=
 see a zero-point flux of=20
energy and momentum coming at it, whereas ordinarily, when the object is no=
t being accelerated, the ZPF is=20
perfectly uniform and symmetric. A key result of our analysis is that these=
 fluxes prove to be=20
proportional to the acceleration of the object, i.e. the more rapid the acc=
eleration, the more the ZPF is=20
distorted. Material objects consist of charged quarks and electrons, which =
will tend to scatter any=20
oncoming electromagnetic flux. When all the quarks and electrons in an obje=
ct scatter the distorted ZPF=20
passing through, the object will experience a kind of drag force. We are pr=
oposing that this might be what=20
the inertia reaction force really is... the drag force due to being acceler=
ated through the vacuum fields.=20
In this view, objects would not intrinsically resist being accelerated; obj=
ects would not possess mass.=20
Mass would really be just a way of characterizing the resistance due to the=
 ZPF molasses (or in the future=20
more general case, the quantum vacuum molasses) that kicks in upon accelera=
tion.a=E2=82=AC|a=E2=82=AC|..A non-geometric=20
(i.e. flat spacetime) approach to gravity is legitimate in quantum gravity.=
 Similarly another non=C2=AC=20
geometric approach would be to assume that the dielectric properties of spa=
ce itself may change in the=20
presence of matter: this can be called the polarizable vacuum (PV) approach=
 to gravity. Propagation of=20
light in the presence of matter would deviate from straight lines due to va=
riable refraction of space=20
itself, and other GR effects such as the slowing down of light (as judged b=
y a distant observer) in a=20
gravitational potential would also occur. But of course it is the propagati=
on of light from which we infer=20
that spacetime is curved in the first place. This raises the interesting po=
ssibility that GR may be=20
successful and yet not because spacetime is really curved: rather because t=
he point-to-point changes in=20
the dielectric (refractive) properties of space in the presence of matter c=
reate the illusion of=20
geometrical curvature. A PV type of model does not directly relate gravitat=
ion to the ZPF (or to the more=20
general quantum vacuum) but it does appear to provide a theoretical framewo=
rk conducive to developing the=20
conjecture of Sakharov that it is changes in the ZPF that create gravitatio=
nal forces"=20

Excerpt Below from: Fran De Aquino=20
http://www.elo.com.br/~deaquino/=20

"Fran De Aquino's research involves many aspects of=20

Gravitation and Cosmology. After thirty years of research the professor De =
Aquino discovered that the=20
gravitational and inertial masses are correlated by a factor, which depends=
 on the incident radiation upon=20
the particle. He showed that there is a direct correlation between the radi=
ation absorbed by the particle=20
and its gravitational mass, independently of the inertial massa=E2=82=AC|.h=
ere is the possibility of control of=20
the gravitational mass by means of the incident radiation. This theoretical=
 result was recently=20
experimentally confirmed ..Consequently there is a strong evidence that the=
 gravitational forces can be=20

Just an obviously curious note: If you were returning from the 1970 's to 2=

How do you figure I have easy access? I can appreciate your skepticism but =
I must admit I'm confused by=20
your choice of questions. I fail to understand why a time traveler would be=
 expected to know the details=20
you ask. Right now, do any of you know the details of the first week in Feb=
ruary for 1970? For that=20
matter, could you tell me from memory if it rained in Atlanta last week? Is=
 a sports almanac a required or=20
expected piece of equipment for all "time machines"?=20

At least you didn't ask the standard "what stocks should I buy" question. I=
nteresting that no one ever asks=20
which stocks to sell. I'm sure my answers will be quite unsatisfying but yo=
u should know I do not want=20
your unshakable faith nor do I think anyone should give it so easily if a "=
time traveler" were able to=20
answer those questions.=20

In fact, over this medium, it's impossible to prove I'm a time traveler, th=
erefore, it's impossible to=20
believe. Actually, I depend on that a great deal so I don't have to worry a=
bout being picked up by your=20

Talking=20

I can understand the ethics at hand here quite well. If you know, for insta=
nce, that someone is going to=20
have a fatal accident, or meet with an unpleasant incident at a specific ti=
me, would you tell them the=20
specifics? I wouldn't. If you knew when Microsoft was going to break, or wh=
ere the next and largest ever=20
earthquake was to hit - would you tell? There is the matter of ethics indee=
d. Who want to force life-=20
changes that are not natural to their path? Paths which intermingle with al=
l other life, indeed creation=20
played out on this earth. No indeed you wouldn't.=20

Yet if a person already knew, as I do, that they are in the history books, =
as I am, but not known widely or=20
available within the community yet - there is a simple challenge. And no - =
I am not talking from any=20
egotistical sense - just one of knowing. However, whether time travellers w=
ish to demonstrate based on the=20
above is up to them. I would certainly be forthright in my confirmation to =
them (private email is allowed=20

But gentlemen and ladies... it also seems that certain 'time travellers' tr=

I personally challenge said time traveller(s) to demonstrate their proof by=

As far as the future goes, your worldline is about 2.5% different than mine=

I'm not aware of any predictions I made or perhaps we do not agree on the d=
efinition. What anyone chooses=20
to do based on something I might say will not affect me in the least. My go=
al is not to believed and I=20
submit that your life would not be any better (and perhaps worse) if you di=
d believe me. You placed=20
"tests" before me that I must pass. Why? What do I have to gain by passing =
them?=20

The fact is there is nothing I can say or show you or let you drop hydrochl=
oric acid on that will "make"=20
you believe me and I really don't want that. It would be nice to discuss yo=
ur view on religion, politics,=20

(1) Industrialized mass production does not produce the uncountable tonnage=
 of useless consumer items so=20
gleefully absorbed by your society. I would estimate there are about 10 uni=

larger units (C206). The main difference is the sensitivity and number of t=

estimate that some sort of public time travel will be common around 2045.=
=20

(2) I'm not aware of any other time traveler's "here" now. But if they are =

Of course I only speak for myself, but I think it's irrelevant and pointles=
s to argue whether or not this=20
man is a Time Traveler or not. This thread sure beats anything else on the =
BBS right now, and it doesn't=20
matter if what John is claiming is fact, a hypothetical exercise or pure BS=
. He's raised some very=20
interesting points that I think would be beneficial for discussion:=20

1) Civil War-considering the current political climate of our country, this=
 is feasible. Figuring in the=20
pervading apathy regarding what has happened in the last couple of months (=
the serious implications should=20
have at least 'clicked' by now), I think something much more drastic would =
have to happen to get Americans=20
off their couches and away from their TV's (or computers) in order to fight=
 for ANYTHING.=20

2) Mass Production-I was thinking the other day how much we waste in this c=
ountry via mass production. I=20
was in a store standing in front of a wall covered with utterly useless 'st=
uff' and the absurdity of it=20
struck me so much I had to laugh. I've always admired Gandhi's belief in do=
ing away with industrializing=20
India in favor of keeping to a much smaller (but more widely spread among t=
he people) production of=20
textiles (ie; 'craftsmen').=20

3) Ethics and Holistic thinking-shouldn't the more prosperous lend a helpin=
g hand to those in less=20
fortunate circumstances, and shouldn't this be done worldwide? I know we in=
 America have allowed ourselves=20
to be lied to regarding what is important and what is not. We seem to be mo=
re valued in this society for=20
what kind of, and how many material possessions we accumulate than for the =
intangible/non-material but=20
longer lasting treasures we might possess.=20

4) Anything is possible. Why not? If you think for yourself, someone like J=
ohn shouldn't be a threat.=20
Haven't you had 'futuristic' dreams? Do you suspect that you are living in =
other timelines or 'realities'-=20
some very similar, some so different that you don't even have a frame of re=
ference in order to understand=20
them with? Do you remember doing this particular incarnation millions of ti=
mes before? Is sanity just too=20
boring for you?=3D)=20

Anyways, I only briefly touched on some of the things John has brought up i=
n his posts (and from the link=20
he posted). Yeah John, I'd like to discuss what ethics and the human condit=
ion would be like in the=20
future.=20

A serious reply please. When you determine the time to which you want to tr=
avel do you "dial in" the date=20
to which you want to go, can you "jump" to a new date, say in 1000 year inc=
rements. Can you "sample" the=20
time period by stopping only for a few moments before continueing your trip=
 and can you take passengers=20
with you????? please answer honestly.=20

Posted by John Titor on 01-31-2001 07:13 PM=20

The distortion unit reaches its target destination by using very sensitive =
gravity sensors and atomic=20

clocks. The basic unit of calculation is the second. So yes, in a sense you=
 do "dial in" in a date and the=20
computer system controls the distortion field. At maximum power, the unit I=
 have is capable of traveling=20
about 10 years an hour.=20

Unfortunately, time travel is not an exact science. There is inherent error=
 and chaos in the computers=20
ability to make accurate calculations. Based on the current technology of t=
he clocks and sensors,=20
distortion units are only accurate to about 60 years or so. So no, in 2036,=
 we are unable to travel back=20
1000 years due to the error rate in the system. The divergence between the =
worldline of origin and the=20
target worldline would be too great. If one were to try and travel back tha=
t far, history would look=20
nothing like what you would expect.=20

The unit has mass limits but the 204 is capable of transporting about three=
 people and equipment. I don't=20

The 5100 had a very simple and unique feature that IBM did not account for =
and decided it was not in their=20
best interest to advertise (which in hindsight was not very smart). This ac=
cidental feature was thus=20
removed from any future desktop computers. In order to take advantage of th=
is feature, the 5100 I have now=20
required a couple of special "tweaks" that had to be done by one of the sof=

who is familiar with this feature and was told to keep their mouth shut abo=

what it is.=20

Yes we still have toilet tissue and some people still suffer from extreme a=

I have noticed and gotten used to the act of verbal conflict as a cathartic=
 entertainment. I don't totally=20
understand it but I take no offense by it either. Perhaps we could just arm=

The year 2008 was a general date by which time everyone will realize the wo=

I would describe it as having a=20
Waco type event every month that steadily gets worse. The conflict will con=
sume everyone in the US by 2012=20
and end in 2015 with a very short WWIII.=20

The source of power for the C204 that allows it to distort and manipulate g=
ravity comes from two=20
microsingularities that were created, captured and cleaned at a much larger=
 and "circular" facility. The=20
dual event horizons of each one and their mass is manipulated by injecting =
electrons onto the surface of=20

this technology will occur within a year or so when CERN brings their large=

Perhaps it would have been clearer to state that the math has been around s=

examine the properties of Kerr black holes and Tipler cylinders. An actual =
working prototype was first=20
tested in 2034. On my worldline, time travel is not a public recreation but=
 we are all aware that it=20
exists. You may be disappointed to know that the ability to manipulate grav=

challenge that had to be overcome. Miniaturizing the clocks and sensors, cr=
eating clever ways to vent x-=20

Question=20

OK, this John Titor guy obviously is really into science fiction, a scienti=

Trust me, I would *really* love to believe that you are from the future. So=
 as Mike suggested, instead of=20
going on about fantastic time machine components and WW3, why not actually =
gain some credibility by=20
correctly telling NEAR future events? Indeed, you are very convincing with =
your stories of what you claim=20
will be, but unless you actually *prove* who you claim to be, quit wasting =
our time...you may as well be=20
beating your head against the wall.=20

Although, if you consistently tell of near-future events, you will rightly =
gain all our respect, and we=20
will be hanging off your every word...=20

As I said, I want to beleive, but don't give us the typical "I don't need t=
o prove myself, I am not here to=20
do that" Well you should be!...Why come on here and spend all that time wit=

consistently* tell of *near*-=20

hing* that we can all relate to...=20

Yes, I age and my hair and nails grow at normal rates. Please keep in mind =
that gravity distortion does=20
involve some dilation effects but "jumping" between worldlines are timelike=
 trips, not spacelike trips.=20

The air is about the same although I do smell and taste industrial odors he=
re my parents cannot. The food=20
in the future is grown and raised naturally inside the community structure.=
 This is done primarily for=20
safety reasons. I am amazed at the risks people here are willing to take wi=
th processed food. All of the=20
food I eat here is grown and prepared by myself or my family. Unfortunately=
, I do not know if we are=20
acquainted on my worldline. Yes, love is a challenge. What's harder is know=
ing you could go back and=20
correct a mistake but at the cost of the "you" on that worldline you want t=
o live your life over again on.=20

The questions about the president and space travel are reasonable but now w=
e come to a conflict between=20
physics and ethics. First, the ethics:=20

I have seen a television program about a man who is able to speak with the =
dead. When I watch the show, I=20
am more afraid about the possibility that what he is doing is real not weat=
her or not he is doing it.=20

Since I will be leaving this worldline in the coming year, I could easily t=
ell you that the President=20
lives or dies in the next four years. In fact, I could probably find some w=
ay to even charge you for it.=20
When the day comes for my "prediction" to be realized it will either happen=
 or not. If it does happen,=20
then your ability to judge your environment is crippled by your acceptance =
of me as a "knower of all=20
things" and gifted with the ability to tell the future. If I am wrong, then=
 everything I have said that=20
might possibly have made you think about your world in a different way is s=
uddenly discredited. I do not=20
want either. Although I do have personal reasons for being here and speakin=
g with you, the most I could=20
hope for is that you recognize the possibility of time travel as a reality.=
 You are able to change your=20
worldine for better or worse just as I am. Although this will make me a far=
 less interesting time=20
traveler, these are the rules I personally try to hold to:=20

1. I will not disclose any information that will cause someone to personall=
y gain by its knowledge. This=20
means no stock or sports tips.=20

2. I will not disclose any detailed information that would allow someone to=
 avoid death by probability.=20

This means no earthquake or bomb information.=20

3. I will not disclose any information that may compromise any future actio=
ns by individual people or=20
threaten their family and well-being. I will not disclose names or events a=
ssociated with individuals.=20

Now for the physics: The grandfather paradox is impossible. In fact, all pa=
radox is impossible. The=20
Everett-Wheeler-Graham or multiple world theory is correct. All possible qu=
antum states, events,=20
possibilities and outcomes are real, eventual and occurring. The chances of=
 everything happening someplace=20
at sometime in the superverse is 100%. (For all you scientists out there, i=
f Schrodinger's cat had a time=20
machine, he might not be in the box at all.)=20

Therefore, there is a worldline where you are alive and another worldline w=
here you have gone back in time=20
to kill your relative and the you on the new worldline won't be born but "y=
ou" the killer is still running=20
around there. Differences between worldlines are measured from the perspect=
ive of the time traveler in=20
terms of divergence percentage. The higher the divergence, the more "un-lik=
e" your destination worldline=20
looks like compared to your worldline of origin.=20

Therefore, any "prediction" I might make has a slight chance of being incor=
rect anyway and you now have the=20
ability to act on it based on what I've said. Can you stop the war before i=
t gets here? Sure. Will you do=20
it? Probably not.=20

John,=20

As I read more and more of your posts, I am admittedly intrigued, but incre=
asingly annoyed by your=20
insistance.=20

OK, fine, there are ethical issues, relating to lotto numbers and gambling,=
 so tell us something like how=20
many will be found dead in the earthquake in India. Tell us=20

something that happens in politics on a national level.=20

Surely you can tell us ^something* that has a neutral moral effect on socie=
ty.=20

You stated:=20

"Although I do have personal reasons for being here and speaking with you, =
the most I could hope for is=20
that you recognize the possibility of time travel as a reality"=20

Tell us something we don't know!! Look at what message board you are on!! H=
ow redundant can one be? Of=20
course it's not unreasonable that most of us on here certainly think that t=
ime travel is a=20
possibility! ! . .come on...=20

"2. I will not disclose any detailed information that would allow someone t=
o avoid death by probability.=20

This means no earthquake or bomb information"=20

Why not? What the hell is wrong with you? If I knew someone was going to be=
 in a situation where they may=20
die, and there was a chance I could stop it, I have the moral obligation to=
 do something about it.=20

John, it's becoming clearer to me that you are simply a fraud...how sad ind=

but you better do it soon.=20

Perhaps it would be better if you just considered me a fraud. I really don'=

I can think of a couple of examples.=20

Question=20

John,=20

I am certainly not uncomfortable in thinking that you are a fraud, although=
 it would bring me (and others)=20
great comfort if you could prove yourself.=20

You chose only to reply to my statement of the moral obligation to help oth=
ers if you knew they were going=20
to die, (but still not directly, as I was saying that if you knew someone w=
ho was going to be in a life-=20
threatening situation, especially a family member or friend, it's your duty=
 to get them out of it...I was=20
not talking about people who knew of their imminent deaths...and your 1941 =
example was not clear...=20

Yet you didn't bother to reply to me when I said that you were being redund=
ant when you say that your wish=20
is to get others to believe that time travel is a possibility. Again, I wil=
l say, that the whole premise=20
of this board is based on the paranormal, and if anything, most of us ^alre=
ady* believe that time travel=20
is a possibility, ncluding myself...so your many posts on this board are on=
 the basis of redundancy.=20

Again I will ask: Tell us something that is morally neutral, like a near-fu=
ture event in Hollywood or=20
politics...something...come on, I am giving you chance after chance, I want=
 to beleive...=20

I am trying to be objective about this, but as you continually evade and do=

I applaud your story. It would make for a great book or Hollywood movie.=20

You keep mentioning ethics as an excuse not to divulge information of the n=

cts about the far future.=20

I have a hard time believing that time travel, if possible and if it will b=

lax way. What would happen if you, while traveling on personel business, di=

what if a scientist reading this thread who in the future will develop time=

Rereading my last post, bogus came off a little strong. I did not mean to c=

First if you don't care if we believe you or not, why are you posting here?=

Are you afraid of altering your reality in our future or your present in th=

this, is there any concern of yours or your comrades that you are affecting=

Is there such a thing, in your reality, as crimes against time? For example=
, killing an enemy while he is a=20
child? Or changing the past to make your present more pleasant (lotteries a=

50% of the world lives on $2.00 a day and a good portion of those not even =
that (general One-Worlder figure=20
per Jimmy Carter on NPR the other day). Many of these people think the whol=
e notion of a western world is=20

About 4 or 5 years ago Art Bell had on a guest involved in researching fera=

HE described how the senior=20

A couple of years before that I had some adventures here in the US. I began=
 traveling around the country=20
staying at Youth Hostels and working where I could. I found myself riding f=
reight trains in the Pacific=20

HE told me about leaving his little village in Oaxaca many years ago. When =

But then I suppose anyone dealing in transvectoring across multiple timeflo=

Really? If you do not believe in Time travel then I suggest for discussion =

As far as the war goes, my best advice is to find at least 5 people within =
100 miles of you that you trust=20
with your life.=20

No, I haven't met any other time travelers here and although from my perspe=
ctive that's highly unlikely,=20
it's not impossible. No, I don't have any additional information concerning=
 crop circles, ETs or UFOs. I=20

 was drawn to this web site.=20

((Can you give us some brief personal stories of your past? For instance, i=

I was born in 1998 so I do share some childhood memories with all of you. I=
 remember going to Disney World=20
at Christmas and I remember going to the beach in Daytona.=20

When the civil "conflict" started and got worse, people generally decided t=
o either stay in the cities and=20
lose most of their civil rights under the guise of security or leave the ci=
ties for more isolated and=20
rural areas. Our home was searched once and the neighbor across the street =
was arrested for some unknown=20
reason. That convinced my father to leave the city.=20

From the age of 8 to 12, we lived away from the cities and spent most of ou=
r time in a farm community with=20
other families avoiding conflict with the federal police and national guard=
. By that time, it was pretty=20
clear that we were not going back to what we had and the division between t=
he "cities" and the "country"=20
was well defined. My father made a living by putting together 12-volt elect=
rical systems and sailing=20
"commodities" up and down the coast of Florida. I spent most of my time hel=
ping him.=20

Outright open fighting was common by then and I joined a shotgun infantry u=
nit in 2011. I served with the=20
"Fighting Diamondbacks" for about 4 years. (Hearing in my right ear isn't a=

civil war ended in 2015 when Russia attacked the U.S. cities (our enemy), C=
hina and Europe. As unusual and=20
bad as my childhood might seem, I wouldn't trade it for anything.=20

Africa is not a pleasant place to be in 2036 although I would characterize =
it as recovering.=20

The music you enjoy now is quite popular and available it's just not produc=
ed in anywhere near the same=20
amount. There is a revival of "local" and classical music. Many people have=
 learned to play their own. I=20

e every possible outcome, event=20
and possibility is happening and will happen, then all good and all evil ba=
lances out in the superverse.=20
After the reality of multiple worlds sank into our collective thought, the =
one basic change to all=20
religious dogma is the concept that good and evil does not exist as an orga=
nized force in our lives nor=20
can it be used as a useful way to judge what God may think of a situation. =
Good and evil are personal=20
experiences that can only guide what we do as individuals and how we relate=
 to others. This outlook also=20
makes it impossible for me to judge any other person or event. We cannot se=
e the entire universe as God=20
sees it therefore we will never be Gods or be capable of judging anything o=
utside of ourselves. My actions=20
can only be judged as good and bad by me and my God.=20

There is also an area of thought that maintains all of the "yous" out there=
 will make up the "you" that=20
eventually returns to God. In that manner, it is frustrating to know that y=
ou are capable of and acting on=20
all of the thoughts and ideas you have regardless of what the "you" here is=
 doing. How good or evil do you=20
think you can be?=20

There is even an idea (supported in physics apparently but I have a hard ti=
me with this one) that there is=20
some sort of communication going on between all of the "yous" that are out =
there. Some people think that=20
memories, intuition and conscious are actually attempts by one version of "=
you" to talk to another.=20

Yes, we still have football and you will easily recognize it in 2036.=20

I am posting here because I enjoy talking with people without having to hid=

my family and I can gather historical information from you and the web.=20

Yes, I have superiors. However, from their perspective, I will only have be=
en gone a split second. The only=20
real risk I am taking is spending too long outside my main line and risking=
 a probability error (dying,=20
accident, etc.). Based on the physics of gravity displacement, I can't leav=
e when I ever I want anyway and=20
I do have some leeway into how I conduct my mission.=20

It is impossible for me to change any worldline that I am not on. Nothing I=
 do here will affect my home.=20

Russia and China have always had a very strange relationship. Even the news=
 I see now indicates that=20

continued weapons deals to allies, border clashes and overpopulation will l=
ead to hostilities. The West=20
will become very unstable which gives China the confidence to "expand". I'm=
 assuming you are all aware=20
that China has millions of male soldiers right now that they know will neve=
r be able to find wives. The=20
attack on Europe is in response to a unified European army that masses and =
moves East from Germany. Also,=20
please be aware that from my viewpoint, Russia attacked my enemy who was in=
 the U.S. cities. Yes, the U.S.=20
did counter attack.=20

Based on what I know about the 5100, it has a few very interesting and wort=
hwhile properties that make it=20
worthwhile for a time traveler to recover. Also, please keep in mind that c=
ivilization is recovering from=20
a war. Yes, we do have the technology but many of the tools were lost.=20

As you are probably aware, UNIX will have a timeout error in 2038 and many =
of the mainframe systems that=20
ran a large part of the infrastructure were based on very old IBM computer =
code. The 5100 has the ability=20
to easily translate between the old IBM code, APL, BASIC and (with a few tw=
eaks in 1975) UNIX. This may=20
seem insignificant but the fact that the 5100 is portable means I can easil=

expect they will create some sort of emulation system to use in multiple lo=

When I arrived, I approached my father and was easily able to prove to him =

Naturally, the conflict in Vietnam and the Middle East come up but as someo=

"Buying a Story" means "I don't buy what you're selling". It's a reaction t=
o a preoccupation we have with=20
issues of "Trust" ...because we have so many interactions with "others" i.e=

in some manner, either to con=20
us (gain our confidence for some gain - possibly financial) or work their w=

John,=20

Again I have to congratulate you on your perceived high level of intelligen=
ce, and I don't doubt that you=20
may indeed be a physics professor or just some guy who gets off misleading =
others.=20

You stated:=20

"2.Anything I say could be acted on beforehand and changed anyway."=20

Not true at all...not ^anything*...just a few days ago there was an attempt=
 at Bush's life, surely that's going=20
to be a significant historical event. It's the first attack/assasination at=
tempt on the president of the=20
new millenium. Hmmm, yeah, you could have warned us days ago about, and it =
may have been changed, and not=20
happened...but that's very very doubtful. At the time, no one would have ta=
ken you seriously anyway...but if=20
you had of predicted that, and it happened, then even I would likely believ=
e you now.=20

Or what about telling us something like a hollywood story of someone breaki=
ng up, or getting married, good=20
luck trying to change that...or of a company's profits...SOMETHING...=20

You are VERY evasive, and you don't give even a single "iota" of evidence..=
.nothing...nadda...zero. I remember=20
you saying that your point of this was to come on and get people to at leas=
t accept the possibility of=20
time travel, well no kidding, great time traveller...sheesh. . look at what=
 message board you are on!! many=20
including myself certainly beleive that it's possible, but all you do is gi=
ve fantastic stories and shrug=20
off any attempt at evidence with your lame excuses. What all of us on here =
want is the truth, not science=20
fiction.=20

"3.All the really interesting information is months or years away and I'd b=
e gone when it happens."=20

Hey, we'll be the judge of that there John. That's not the point whether th=
e information is interesting,=20
that's subjective, the point is that you should prove yourself. It's true t=
hat you claim to be a scientist=20
right? Well isn't one of the aims of scientists is to prove to *others* of =
their hypothesis or theory.=20

Even if you're not one, you should still make an ^attempt* at trying to pro=
ve yourself.=20

"4.1 find it morally wrong to assist someone with anything where they might=
 gain and someone else would=20
lose or die."=20

OK fine...so why don't tell us a way in which we can save lives or help peo=
ple without harming others...like of=20
car accidents...what plane trip not to take...etc?! And don't come back wit=
h the cliched, "well it wouldn't be=20
morally right to change the future"...you are morally obligated to help som=
eone if you can stop it!! You=20
can't argue with that.=20

John, why don't you quit claiming that you're from the future and actually =
make any attempt to prove that=20
you are...=20

This is scary almost, does this guy actually beleive in what he says? or di=

There is no way I can know if you are real time traveler, I'm asking you qu=

My rational, logical mind says you are nothing but a bored cyber geek with =

Question=20

John is there anything you can let us know about the future? I know you are=
 doing the whole "not gonna tell=20
any real information due to money being made off betting on the information=
 you tell us". But can you just=20
name some people who will be major tv stars or movie stars, or future major=
 politicians or major=20
companies? Or even other major technologies besides the obvious that we are=
nt aware of?=20

Posted by John Titor on 02-08-2001 06:59 PM=20

This post addresses what I have seen before the last three. I enjoy the con=
versation and I will respond.=20

The "pattern" of exchange in the war will not be a surprise. Many people wi=
ll perish as a result of=20

starvation and disease. I would also submit that you already know if you're=
 safe or not. The trick is to=20
not turn off your fear when you'll need it the most.=20

Australia is sort of interesting in what is unknown. After the war, they we=
re not very cooperative or=20
friendly (can't blame them really). It is known they did repulse a Chinese =
invasion and most of their=20
cities were hit. They have a trading relationship with the U.S. but I would=
 characterize them as reclusive=20
and ticked off.=20

When people use phrases like "See what I mean", "You're not hearing what I'=
m saying" or "Something smells=20
fishy", they are indicating the primary sense they use to process informati=
on about a situation. I find it=20
interesting that my credibility and the phrases that describe it hinge on e=
conomic terms and whether or=20
not I have something to sell. I don't. I also don't know how to clarify my =
position any better so I would=20
suggest that if what I say angers you, it might be best to just consider it=
 fiction. Soon you'll get bored=20
and I will leave in a few months. Either way, it won't be an issue.=20

The "enemy" that was attacked by Russia in the U.S. was the forces of the g=
overnment you live under right=20
now.=20

((...or just some guy who gets off misleading others.))=20

I do not seek followers to mislead. I seek safety, animosity and good conve=
rsation.=20

(2) . To me it would seem obvious that we both have a very different perspe=
ctive on what's important right=20
now in 2001. I would think that's what makes our interaction interesting. W=
ould I be anymore believable if=20
I told you I had just stopped a horrible event and you won't hear about it =
because it didn't happen?=20

Again, this is the second time it has come up and I am very curious. Why wo=
uld you expect a time traveler=20
to know or care about what happens in Hollywood or some individual companie=
s profits? You seem to think I=20
have tomorrow's paper in front of me. Is that what time travel means to you=
?=20

(3) I never said I was a scientist. If this is about economics somehow and =
you hope to "buy" my story, then=20
what do I gain by "selling" it?=20

(5) You already know that cars are dangerous and planes crash. I'm very con=
fident you are capable of=20
killing yourselves without my intervention. Actually, my moral obligation h=
as nothing to do with you, it's=20
between me and God.=20

Deception? Exactly what standard do you use to measure the truth around you=
? I have seen other threads with=20
amazing and potentially real experiences on them. Why am I more threatening=
?=20

I have no memory of meeting an older me as a three year old. The events bet=
ween worldlines are isolated and=20
nothing I do here will affect my worldline. Yes, my parents are alive in 20=
36 but they have no experience=20

Hi John:=20

I've read all the postings here and I sense that what we have here is a fai=
lure to communicate. It's been=20
my experience that the majority of posters on this board are genuinely open=
 minded, and ready to believe.=20
Actually I'm intrigued by the escalating level of frustration being experie=
nced here, and wonder where=20
it's going.=20

In my opinion you have sparked a good discussion here. If you are from the =
future, then we all have=20
something to learn from you. If you are not, then it's a good game of cat a=
nd mouse, and since audience=20
participation is not mandatory, I really have no reason to be upset with yo=
u. For me the challenge here is=20
two-fold.=20

1. To try and somehow get you to validate yourself without violating your e=
thics.=20

2. To try to get you to trip yourself up, and prove yourself a hoax.=20

Either way in the end we all get what we wanted.=20

Rather than degenerating into a "let's get John mob" I propose we try to de=
vise creative lines of=20
questioning to get to the bottom of the "John Titor" story.=20

I don't believe animosity is a requirement for a satisfying excercise in th=
inking. We do need to level the=20
playing field so it would be helpful if you would agree to a few "rules of =
sportsmanship" (pardon the P.I.=20
sexist reference).=20

You have more than once noted your disdain for our colloquialisms and cultu=
ral inclinations. This is=20

inherently unfair, and you should give it some thought. You being the "TT",=
 have an unfair advantage here.=20
We do live in an economy based society and it's natural for us to use terms=
 like, "Im sold". You used the=20
term "off the cuff" in your comments about "buying in", does this mean in t=
he future "cuffs" have some=20
cultural significance? or is it simply a familiar concept? ....food for tho=
ught.=20

I of course only speak for myself, so here are my questions.=20

1. Is John Titor your real name? (just kidding)=20

2. What is the name of your locality/State/Country?=20

18. Did the N.W.O turn out to be real? or just vapor?=20

19. Do you have teleportation for the average citizen?=20

20. Was AIDS created by the government?=20

21. Are there gays in the military?=20

25. Is VR legal?=20

26. What is the average lifespan?=20

27. Why are you still using paper money?=20

28. As far as you know who is the most significant figure of the 21st centu=
ry.=20

29. Do you use Tesla technology?=20

30. Given the differentials values you quoted, why can't your technology co=
mpensate by offsetting the=20
target coordinates so the error puts you in the correct "world time"?=20

31. Do you have the death penalty?=20

32. What is the most common crime commited?=20

33. Is race mixing allowed?=20

34. Is cloning common practice?=20

43. Are there recreational drugs?=20

44. Do you remember the Beatles?=20

45. What is the name of the Pope? (name changes)=20

If you answer these questions you will not violate any of your rules except=
 for question #1, so I'll=20
retract that one.=20

That's my 2 cents=20

Posted by Craig Cuthbert on 02-09-2001 12:33 PM=20

I would say if this is all legit - and I'm leaning that way as I would rath=
er it be, and I have nothing at=20
stake - that the whole issue is very much about divergence. Onb certain lev=
els divergences matter very=20
little. For instance, did it really matter whether you got gas, last Thurs.=
, at an AMPM (amp 'em) or a=20
Chevromn Quik Mart? If a timeline was altered and on a new line you found y=
ourself gassing up at a Texaco=20
Food Mart AFTER you went to the Library, as opposed the AM/PM (amp 'em) bef=
ore you went to the school=20
board meeting - would it matter? Suppose you went back in time and suggeste=
d to your bonehead cousin that=20
he should get a job at the new service center down the street. And he met s=
ome girl there, they got=20
married and now you get to visit them once every year in LAs Vegas? Suppose=
 you suggested he try=20
telemarketing at 1 800 RIGHT-IN-THE MIDDLE-OF-DINNER and he lasted 3.5 week=
s and then found a job in Vegas=20
dealing cards and then met some girl there. I guess my point is that differ=
ent divergences have different=20
"loads" of importance.=20

Enough ... though true freedom means looking at these consequences on a mor=
e continual basis than one would=20
have if one were used to a more routinized existence. I find this whole top=
ic of divergence to be the more=20
intriguing topic (though I would like to know what Chinese pop culture will=
 look like.=20

Posted by John Titor on 02-09-2001 02:02 PM=20

For all of you interested in coming back with me to 2036, perhaps we should=
 discuss the trip. Please be=20
aware, the displacement unit moves through time, not space. First, we will =
be driving the current vehicle=20
(Chevy truck) with the displacement unit in it to Tampa Florida. From there=
, we will go back to my arrival=20
date on this worldline. Then we will have to drive to Minnesota, sell the c=
urrent vehicle and get another=20
one that would have been around in 1975. We will then move the displacement=
 unit (500 lbs or so) into the=20
new vehicle and go back to 1975. Once in 1975, we'll drive back to Tampa an=
d make the final hop to 2036.=20

If you'd like to stay in 1975, you're welcome to do that. It can also get q=
uite hot and stuffy during the=20

trip and you'll be subjected to a 1.5 to 2 G force the entire time. You'll =
also need some sort of a re=C2=AC=20

breather system or oxygen supply.=20

I have found that many misunderstandings and arguments are based on the dif=
ferences in understanding over a=20
single word. Two different cultures can have a drastic impact on the meanin=
g of words like "proof",=20

"trust" and "credibility". My frustration is in understanding the use of th=
e words. I am trying to follow=20
the logic of all of the comments.=20

After reading the questions, I want to paint a picture that may help with t=
he general theme of our=20

collective experience in 2036. The war had very profound affects on people =
and how they relate to each=20
other. As individuals, almost everyone in 2036 is very familiar with death.=
 We all have stories of loved=20
ones that have died from disease, war or acts of inhumanity. Most of us hav=
e even taken part in dishing=20
the same thing out to the other side. As a result, we have become far more =
compassionate to the ones we=20

love but mush less forgiving to those who don't pull their weight. We are m=
ore accepting of other's=20

differences in our community because we depend on them to survive. We are a=
lso more conservative with our=20
resources and closer to God because for a period, life on Earth was Hell.=
=20


182=20


The other major difference is in the concept of good and evil. With multipl=
e worlds come multiple decisions=20
and outcomes. For every good act, there is an equal and possible bad act on=
 another worldline. Taken to=20
the extreme, this must mean that in God's eyes, there is no total good and =
total bad in the superverse. It=20
balances itself out to infinity. I believe we are judged on the decisions w=
e make as individuals and the=20
good/evil I see on my worldline is an illusion that has no worth to God. My=
 reaction to it is what's=20
important to God. Although this may seem rather heartless, it does allow me=
 to see past the evil that=20
people do and acknowledge the core of potential goodness inside them.=20

2. I am currently based in Tamp Florida in Hillsborough County.=20

3. Yes I am free but I have obligations as a citizen. Everyone is required =
to have basic military training=20
and provide a period of time for community service. It is very much like a =
type of mandatory National=20
Guard service + Peace Corps.=20

4. Yes civil liberties are more important. You will feel the same after hav=
ing your house searched a couple=20
of times.=20

5. We do not live in a racist society but definitely a prejudice one. Every=
one carries their own water.=20


183=20


6. Our government looks very much like yours. It is a representative republ=
ic.=20

7. My definition of a patriot is anyone who defends the Constitution agains=
t all enemies, foreign and=20
domestic.=20

8. Religion has become far less centralized. Extremes tend to bring you clo=
ser to God so I would=20
characterize religion and spirituality as a much more of a personal institu=
tion.=20

9. I do not know what happens when we die. However, I don't think it will b=
e easy. There may be some very=20
difficult decisions we have to make when we die that we are totally unprepa=
red for.=20

10. It's difficult to define the most predominant religion. Christianity ha=
s fragmented into many groups=20
and people with different beliefs speak mush more openly with others who ha=
ve different outlooks and=20
opinions. I would imagine there are large groups of Hindus, Buddhists and M=

 Jesus returns, do you think=20
he'll be a lamb or a lion?=20

15. I'm not aware of any "mind control" devices being used on you now. Howe=
ver, there are a great many "non=20
lethal" weapon systems in development that turn out to be quite lethal. Som=
etimes I watch your television=20
programs that show SWAT teams using new non-lethal weapons. They usually st=
art out with, "In the future,=20
the army and police will fight its enemies with new weapons systems..." Whe=
n they use the word "enemy",=20
they're talking about YOU! You don't really think the Marines are going to =
jump out of helicopters=20

just have another word for it.=20

17. Yes, Europe is a mess.=20

of the old U.S. federal system, Europe, Canada and Australia.=20

19. When you say "teleportation", I assume you mean public transportation. =
Yes, we have a basic high-speed=20

20. I don't know if the government created AIDS. I tend to think yes but co=

22. Yes, there are "gay" people in 2036.=20

23. I am a white male.=20

24. Yes, there is an entertainment industry. Again, it is very decentralize=

Much of the distribution is over the web. I would compare it theater here.=

 opinion is the farmer-general=20
who led us to victory.=20

29. Even for you Tesla technology can be found in appliances, motors and ge=
nerators. I would have to say we=20

30. Getting back to my exact worldline of origin is impossible but it depen=
ds on how you define the correct=20
worldline. I can get close enough so neither I nor anyone there would know =
the difference. It relates to=20
the classic example of cutting a distance in half to reach it. You can alwa=
ys get closer but never there.=20
It also has a lot do with neighboring universes on Penrose diagrams but tha=
t requires more math.=20

31. Yes, we have the death penalty. We also have public punishment.=20

32. The most common crime is theft.=20

33. I don't understand what you mean by "race mixing".=20

34. Cloning is not common. However, altering the sperm and egg cell are com=

have children in 2036 for environmental reasons.=20

35. It's hard to say what the exact racial make up of the U.S. is. I would =
say it's probably the same minus=20
130 million people or so.=20

36. No, there is no segregation.=20

37. The education system is very similar to yours but the organization and =
implementation is controlled on=20
a community and county level. Various communities also specialize in certai=
n disciplines.=20

38. 39. My comments on equal rights and "women's roles" could be quite leng=
thy and controversial. I wish to=20
discuss that separately. However, women do fight in the military just as th=

community level is very conservative.=20

40. Having children is such a serious issue in 2036 that birth control is a=
lmost unheard of. It is very=20
difficult and precious to have and raise children. Again, this is an issue =
I will be happy to go into=20
later.=20

41. Yes, there are same sex marriages but it's not very common. Again, peop=

hardship that if what someone else is doing does not affect them or harm th=

issue.=20

42. South America went relatively unharmed. However, there is still a great=

conventional arms.=20

43. Yes, people use drugs that alter consciousness but they are not very co=

You mention a full scale nuclear weapons deployment as a result of WWIII. Y=

electronics, computers, and even the Internet still functioning some time a=
fter that. Can you explain how=20
these devices (and more importantly the facilities that made them) withstoo=
d the EMP airbursts associated=20
with any full scale nuclear war? Every electronic device would be inorperab=

would take decades (if even possible) to rebuild the infrastructure to allo=

electric razor, let alone an Internet.=20

Thumbs up=20

John,=20

First, thanks for the insightful answers. I have to admit that the overall =
picture you paint, sounds very=20
real, and sobering. As you accurately detected my questions were really an =
excercize in profiling. You are=20
either from the future as you say, or you are the next Robert Heinlein.=20

As for me, in as much as I have been given to understand by your answers yo=
u don't have the mentality of a=20
hoaxer. Actually you sound like a 30 something, militia member who has expe=
rienced much hardship, and your=20
calm yet aggressive demeanor indicates you are accustomed to making difficu=
lt decisions. Your "skirting"=20
of the "equality" issue and your use of the word "prejudiced" is indicative=
 of the kind of hard, post war=20
climate you claim to be from, and the measures that would be required for s=
urvival. I assume your comment=20
"everyone carries their own water" was both literal and figurative? and is =
the equivalent of "our" "you=20
have to carry your own weight"?=20

As a programmer, the UNIX issue you refer to is a bit of a problem. I write=
 code in APL, PLI, Lisp, C, C++,=20
VB, Fortran , Cobol, Smalltalk, Java, Python, and a slew of less known lang=
uages. The 2038 "bug" is about=20
as dangerous as the Y2K bug. I can "with a little tweaking" do anything wit=
h a computer that can be done=20
with a computer. I assume there are programmers in 2036, that being the cas=
e, a "good programmer" can fix=20
your Y2K38 date inconsistency. As for the undocumented IBM design modificat=
ion in the 5100, I know nothing=20
so I can't comment there.=20

The new .net platform from microsoft has the capability to integrate all th=
e languages you mentioned + all=20
the ones I mentioned. Would it not be easier to write in the original langu=
age instead of having a machine=20
translation?=20

Can you tell me how your UNIX differs from ours?=20

As for proof, I don't think any is forthcoming that would be "conclusive".=
=20

At this point I have no concrete reason to disbelieve anything you say save=
 for standard skepticism.=20

I'd like to discuss some current technology with you in private if you have=
 the time. If you can E-mail me=20
I'd appreciate it.=20

Good luck John, you're an interesting person, thanks for the conversation.=
=20

PS. Thurston Howell is the name of a character on "Gilligand's Island", for=
 a definition of psionics you=20

Waco, Ruby Ridge and Elian exist in your news archives. Telling you about i=
mpending place crashes or other=20
disasters (provided I could give you exact dates and times) may save lives =
at one point but cause=20
cascading changes that take others at a later point.=20

I enjoy the posts because it's very hard to remain safe and have a conversa=
tion. I have often seen the=20
classic question, "why don't time travelers revel themselves'? That's easy,=
 if you believe us, you'll drug=20
us into oblivion and put us in a small dark cell while men in white lab coa=
ts take a Phillips head screw=20
driver to the magnetic lock on the singularity drive housing.=20

1 will examine the web site you mentioned. I believe the 5100 is unique in =
its ability to run assembler=20
language on the 360-machine platform and still be portable. I'm not sure if=
 that fact was ever made public=20
so it's the best "proof" I have. I would like to examine the software you m=
entioned; perhaps I can further=20
justify my side-trip.=20

Yes, EMP took out a great number of electronic devices. That's one of the r=
easons why we don't have=20

reliable technology laying around. However, in the opening hours of N Day, =
the Russians did not launch any=20
high altitude detonations. They knew we would most likely clean up after th=
em so they wanted everyone=20
outside the cities to be able to communicate. Most of the warheads that hit=
 the cities came in threes and=20
exploded close to the ground. The heavy EMP damage was isolated to those ar=
eas.=20

Actually, you will probably be quite impressed with our internet. It's base=
d on a series of independent,=20
self-powered nodes that are mobile and can be put up anywhere. It looks a g=

Do you think it's very smart to be talking to people online?=20

Question=20

please forgive me if you have already responded to a similar question - but=
 i am a very curious person &amp;=20
can not wait to ask this..just incase i forget., my question:=20
you say that you can not tell us when something of very little historical i=
mportance occurs., because we=20
may alter/change something &amp; look to you as a phsycic of some sort, per=
haps, you could mention something=20
that will happen very soon after you've just left, no one will be able to c=
ontact you so what could they=20
possibly change and/or ask you about? as someone has suggested: over time p=
eriods certain types of music=20
run to the forfront of our society, in the early 90's it was grunge., now i=
t seems to be the bubbly pop=20
teen sensations, i.e. backstreet boys &amp; britney spears., you couldn't e=
ven answer the simple question of=20
what will be the next 'movement' in music? just something so simple as that=
., couldn't possibly have some=20
profound affect on the future? &amp; especially for just the people on this=
 board..i have my doubts that=20
they'd run out &amp; "do something" about the fact that acid jazz (for inst=
ance) is the next big musical hit.,=20
know what i mean?=20

more questions: dunno if you've been asked this, but what are the areas lea=
st affected by the ww3 bombings=20
..you will probably not be able to answer that., just going to see if you w=
ill anyway, another thing i=20
wanted to mention was that even though you think because of one small thing=
 you say may affect the future=20
greatly, i assure you that 90% of the people., will not take it seriously, =
so if you said: "the eastern=20
shore will be most affected."..i doubt that in 2012 everyone will swarm to =
the west, of the large=20
population our world has., it is very small in comparison to the population=
 of -this-board-.. &amp; our=20
country is full of skeptics (which i'm sure you've realized)., so even if 1=
00 people said "the eastern=20
shore will not be affected., a traveler from the future -said so-!!!"., may=
be 1 or 2 people would actually=20
believe them, i think the affect you think you'd have..is not as large as i=
t really would be.=20
another: have you visited your -past- family? what city were you born in/gr=
ew up in? could you even say=20
that so-and-so.. *an unknown person in today's history*.."will be a big sta=

I've read this entire forum through twice now.=20

What I find fasinating more than John's Time Traveling, are the people who =
seem to be attacking him. Now, I=20
"believe" that Time Travel is possible - and I think there is plenty of phy=
sics evidence for this. So -=20
perhaps the word "belief " is really not the correct word.=20

I have a couple of questions for John as well, so if you can answer these J=
ohn, I would appreciate your=20
answers.=20

1) Once a microsingularity is produced and placed in statis in a magnetic f=
ield, what is the approximate=20
strength of that magnetic field.=20

2) How is the magnetic field produced (I mean - what power source holds the=
 field in place)?=20

3) What would happen to the microsignularity if that source FAILED? For ins=
tance would the microsingularity=20
begin to grow? Or would it cease to exist?=20


186=20




In relation to my first comments about folks attacking John's veracity - I =
have to say that John's=20
stories/statements DO hold water. The folks that chose not to believe him a=
re welcome to do so, but, you=20
do not have to "save anyone" from themselves or John. I believe most of us =
are intelligent enough to=20
determine for ourselves if there is any kind of fraud. Even if there IS fra=
ud, I personally am impressed=20
with the background. It is well thought-out and consistent so far.=20

John has stated several times that what he says will not affect us, or him,=
 and what we say will not affect=20
him whatsoever. I have to take that to mean that even if he DOES tell you s=
omething here, it will NOT=20
affect HIS timeline, since there is some deviation from his actual timeline=
 here. In other words, John is=20
NOT the same John he is visiting now, as his 3 year old self. His mom and d=
ad are NOT his REAL mom and dad=20
in his time line. We are NOT the same PEOPLE IN HIS TIME LINE.=20

Therefore, John (and none of you could do this either) can NOT tell us anyt=
hing about our current timeline=20
with any great accuracy that can be verified.=20

Think about it.=20

another thing i do not understand,=20
you said in a previous post:=20

"I am no more able to affect your worldline than you are. Yes, I could make=
 the changes you suggested but=20
you must remember that there are an infinite number of worldlines out there=
 where I didn't and I don't. In=20
fact, there's even a worldline out there where you're the time traveler and=
 I'm the one writing the=20
question.=20

I think the war would be good for you and your society. I don't want to sto=
p it.=20

Nothing I do here will affect any other worldline. "My" original worldline =
will always be the same and yes=20
I can make changes here that would make this worldline different from mine =
but so can you."=20
from this i suppose that you mean, that yes, you could &amp; possibly have =
affected our 'worldline'.. &amp; our=20
worldline is different from -your- worldline., if this is true then why do =
you keep telling us about the=20
ww3..etc.. how do you know that will even -happen- in our worldline? it may=
 have already been nipped in=20
the bud for all you know..because ours is a different -worldline- from your=
s!=20
another thing i wanted to respond to:=20

"(2). To me it would seem obvious that we both have a very different perspe=
ctive on what's important right=20
now in 2001. I would think that's what makes our interaction interesting. W=
ould I be anymore believable if=20
I told you I had just stopped a horrible event and you won't hear about it =
because it didn't happen?=20

Again, this is the second time it has come up and I am very curious. Why wo=
uld you expect a time traveler=20
to know or care about what happens in Hollywood or some individual companie=
s profits? You seem to think I=20
have tomorrow's paper in front of me. Is that what time travel means to you=
? "=20
i understand what you're saying .. why would you care what happens in holly=
wood..etc.. or individual=20
companies profits., what you're basically saying is you just don't remember=
 (or maybe you do..but you=20
won't tell us?)., why would you care? if you asked anyone today who, for in=
stance: marilyn monroe is., we=20
would all know.. or who bill gates was &amp; what he did for computers - we=
 would all know, you're insinuating=20
that you don't know &amp;/or don't care about any of these things in the fu=
ture, perhaps so..but how could you=20
POSSIBLY not know who the next big inventor is., or what the invention is. =
you claim that if you told us.,=20
we could alter it &amp; keep it from happening, how many people do you thin=
k will be SO concerned that a -=20
mega-super-razor- that keeps all facial hair gone for 20 days (for example)=
.. that they want to go &amp; stop=20
the inventor from inventing it? &amp; also you said, you'd be gone by the t=
ime the 'good stuff' happens., ok.,=20
isn't that -further- better for your point..in that you say it's better to =
have us be skeptics rather than=20
sheep? well if you told us "in 2 years, there will be an earthquake in isra=
el".. &amp; you were gone by=20
then..all we could do is say, "wow, that guy on the board in 2001 said this=
 would happen! he was real!".,=20
we couldn't -do- anything.. we couldn't STOP the eartquake &amp; i doubt an=
yone would go there &amp; tell everyone=20
to evacuate (and even if they did, no one would!)., it would just prove tha=
t you were -true- &amp; existed, i=20
can't fathom why you can not speak of something such as that..=20

Posted by Rick Donaldson on 02-12-2001 11:14 AM=20

John - Another question suddenly came to mind. I asked before about the mic=
rosingularities. Are they used=20
to create the "rotating tipler cylinder" somehow through the axis of your t=
ime machine? All matter within=20
a certain distance is then pushed (somehow) along a time-dilation type trip=
 in time, forward or backward.=20
Is this about right? I'm betting that (assuming this is real) the microsing=
ularities are used to create the=20
infinite length aspect of the tipler cylinder which appears to be required =
for this time function change=20
to occur. The aspect of rotating microsingularities (MS from now on) means =
that some sort of gravational=20
field between the MS is also rotating, so as to create this illusion of a g=
ravitational cylinder AROUND=20
WHICH TIME IS DISTORTED GREATLY!!=20

Hmmmm... I'm about to start believing this guy, John the Time Traveler is r=

on to what is going on now, we=20
are not familiar or have no knowledge of Time Travel actually happening bef=
ore this.=20

Another thing about people saying how John doesn't know any World Events th=
at are about to happen in the=20
next few months. But you have to remember, that the last time John was in o=
ur time, assuming he hasn't=20
traveled back was when he was 3 years old! How many of you can honestly say=
 you remember at-the-time=20
important issues that happened when you were 3! I know I can't!=20

John, now, I would like to ask you a few things I am curious about! This is=
 something I have found to be=20
very interesting and could possibly believe you!=20

(1) Have you ever went on any other time traveling missions? If so, what we=
re they?=20

(2) 1 believe you said you had pictures of your time machine, could you pos=
t a link to uploaded images?=20

(3) If you have any pictures of the IBM computer you were susposed to get, =
could you post a link to them=20
also?=20

(4) 1 looked up the name 'Titor' in the state of Flordia on 555-1212.com an=
d couldn't find ANY Titors, is=20
your family not listed in the phone book?=20

(5) Can I contact you through any other means of online communications? Lik=
e AOL Instant Messagner? ICQ?=20

MSN? Something so I can have a conversation with you! But if you don't have=
 those, could you possibly=20
consider downloading one of them, http://www.AIM.com, http://www.ICQ.com. A=
nd then emailing me your user=20
name abcs_123s@hotmail.com , thanks!=20

(6) What is the specific Date that the Nuclear war starts? If you can't rem=
ember the exact date, could you=20
put the month at least? An estimate!=20

(7) What is the speed of the average computer in the future? I am assuming =
it is in ghZ, if it is higher,=20
could you post the name of that hZ measurement and its relation to the ghZ?=
=20

(8) Can you do your own Time Traveling ventures whenever you want? If so, h=
ow much does it cost? Or can you=20
make 'pit stops' along the way back to 2036?=20

(9) Have you ever went past your future, like to 2050 or somewhere around t=
here? If so, what is the world=20
like then?=20

Also, someone said why does he think that there will be a WW3 in our world =
since it isn't the same as his.=20
Well, John said that there is a 2.5% difference from our world and his, tha=
t isn't that much of a=20
difference, so a WW3 is very likely to happen if what he says is true and t=
here is only that much of a=20
difference!=20

I was born in 1957. I DO remember the 1962 crisis, at least in terms of the=
 adults being scared. I would=20
have been 5 years old. I distinctly remember John Glenn going up and splash=
ing down, and I remember=20
hearing about Alan Sheppard (first man in space for you younguns hehe).=20

I indeed remember watching John Glenn though. I remember Walter Cronkites v=
oice on television. I can tell=20
you what my house looked like back then, the size of the TV and that it was=
 black and white. I remember=20
playing with magnets back then, and being absolutely fascinated with the ma=
gic of magnetic fields even=20
then (which eventually drove me into the sciences, chemistry, physics and f=
inally electronics=20
engineering).=20

I remember a TV show called "Time Tunnel" in the late 60's. Anyone else?=20

Anyway, the basic point is, I do have very vivid memories of things from wh=
en I was a child, of no more=20
than 3-4. I have very, very clear memories of things when I was 3 and even =
my mom when she was alive was=20
amazed at the things I could recall from such a young age. Well... I don't =
remember much about politics=20
though. I know that Eisenhower was the Prez when I was born, but... I don't=
 remember ANYTHING about him, but=20
I DO remember all KINDS of things about Kennedy.=20

So... what I am getting at, John would not necessarily (nor would anyone el=
se) remember things of politics in=20
their baby years. Some of us do, many of us do not.=20

I can tell you something very important to me though... if *1* stepped into=
 a time machine to go back to... say=20
1961 or 1962 I ABSOULTELY would have a complete knowledge of the era that I=
 was returning to, in my mind.=20
I'd have studied it very carefully, and I would ensure I had clothing of th=
at era (up to and including the=20
geeky classes I used to wear as a kid) to "fit in". 1962 was a year of the =
almost end of the human race as=20
we know it now, and I CERTAINLY would not want to step into a time where I =
could have been noticed as=20
being out of place and out of time. Curiousity about me might cause my arre=
st or anything else in those=20
days.=20

As a 43 year old grandpa, I know a LOT more now, than I did then. I KNOW th=
at if I had the chance to go see=20
it with what I know now, I would take that chance. I also know that I proba=
bly would NOT pass on=20
intelligence from the future as a matter of course. I would not communicate=
 with anyone who might be able=20
to discern my intent, or even anything about the future from me.=20

Even if I were 2.6% off track from my time line. Even if I were 45% off tra=
ck, I would not give anyone the=20
chance to gloam on to anything I said about the future.=20

John, I have a few more questions. These ones are more about the 'War', and=
 the state of your world.=20

(1) Who is the Major Super Power?=20

(2) Are the two political parties still Republicans and Democrats?=20

(3) How many States are there?=20

(4) Which states get the worst?=20

(5) Were only cities along the Eastern Sea port hit in the Nuclear War, or =
all over the country?=20

(6) Do companys like Microsoft, Yahoo!, and other internet software company=
s still exist?=20

(7) Does money look alot different than it does now? If you have a picture,=
 could you please upload it and=20
post the link!=20

(8) So then when you time travel you can never actually go back to the EXAC=
T same place you left from?=20

(9) Was alot of the United States' 18-24 age group slaughtered in the war b=
ecause of Draft?=20

(10) Do you ever get visitors from later time periods to 2036?=20

(11) Are there any other companys, besides the one you work for that have T=
Ts and send them out regularly?=20

(12) Does the government know there is TT going on?=20

(13) Why were YOU selected to be a TT? What gave you special qualifications=
?=20

(14) How many TTs are there on the team that you are on? How do new recruit=

(15) What all countrys are on our side in the war? What all countrys are on=
 the oposite side?=20

(16) Which country gets the worst in the war?=20

Thank you Vega for the information. I will visit the site and I expect I wi=
ll have some questions.=20

Yes, there are a great many people who think that Revelations has come to p=
ass. However, the new fear is=20
that Christ has returned, he's not telling us and he's very angry. I am not=
 familiar with the Fatima=20
Prophesies but I am aware of the term. I was not sent here to change anythi=
ng. Since it would not affect=20
my home anyway, it would be rather pointless. I am here because of my famil=
y and the interaction I had=20
with them in 1975. I understand the question about the Antichrist but I mus=
t admit I hadn't given it much=20
thought. My initial reaction is to consider how the Antichrist would affect=
 my life if I could identify=20
him/her. If your life became a sort of "Hell" anyway, would it matter if th=
e Antichrist was real?=20

I became aware of this bulletin board through my various archiving work thr=
ough the web. We do enjoy "talk=20
programs" but they are distributed over the web. I don't have additional in=
formation about UFOs and I find=20
the subject quite interesting myself. I have often wondered if they aren't =
time travelers with very=20
sophisticated machines. Based on what I know about the nature of time I fin=
d this difficult to believe but=20
nothing is impossible.=20

Yes, handmade items and the skills to make them are quite prevalent and peo=
ple take a great deal of pride=20
in their work. People with the skills to make clothing, work with leather a=
nd wood or cultivate a garden=20
have become quite valuable. Please do not think your questions are unimport=
ant. I enjoy the conversation.=20

Fiji? I've noticed that when most Americans think about Canada in this time=
, they think about pine trees,=20
chooks and back-bacon. It may interest you to know that most Canadians in 2=
036 are some of the most=20
efficient, ruthless and dangerous people I know. God help Quebec.=20

Within limits, I'm confident my anonymity is secure. The various email and =
web accounts I have do not have=20
a big sign that says "Time Machine This Way -a". In order to be at risk I w=
ould have to be believed. In my=20
experience, evil may be powerful, but they aren't very bright.=20

((you couldn't even answer the simple question of what will be the next 'mo=
vement' in music? just something=20
so simple as that))=20

Unfortunately, your question is rather difficult for me. Any personal exper=
ience I might have with your=20
worldline at a specific moment is limited to my viewpoint and age. I can't =
tell you what music is popular=20
in the next few years because the "me" here is only three years old. In add=
ition, how does someone decide=20
what the most popular music trend is? It would seem rather subjective to me=
. Thinking about it now I sort=20
of wonder what it would be like to be a teenager now and know the answer to=
 that question. When I was=20
thirteen I used to worry about which shotgun slug would take a door handle =
off and whether or not I had=20
any dry socks. Current fallout estimates are accurate but a bit exaggerated=
.=20

Your example of what people would do based on something I might say is accu=
rate. However, my concern would=20
be the potential actions of a single person, not the masses. In 1963, if I =
suggested that someone should=20
watch the book depository windows as the President went by, the actions of =
a single person might have a=20
huge impact on history. You also asked if I've visited my "past" family. Th=
at's where I am now.=20

((1) Once a micro-singularity is produced and placed in statis in a magneti=
c field, what is the approximate=20
strength of that magnetic field.=20

2) How is the magnetic field produced (I mean - what power source holds the=
 field in place)?=20

3) What would happen to the microsignularity if that source FAILED? For ins=
tance would the microsingularity=20
begin to grow? Or would it cease to exist?))=20

These are excellent questions that I probably won't answer to your satisfac=
tion but let me make a couple of=20
points first. Although I am familiar with the general manufacture of the un=
it, I am not a physicist or a=20
scientist. My background is in history and I had the correct profile to acc=
omplish my given task in 1975.=20

I doubt that most jet fighter pilots are aeronautical engineers and I'll be=
t most of you couldn't give me=20
the formula for horsepower, yet you drive a car every day.=20


190=20


The second point I can illustrate with an interesting story. In the opening=
 phases of WWI, one of the=20
largest problems early fighter pilots had was how to shoot a machine gun th=
rough the propeller blades=20
without chopping it to bits. The problem was very straightforward. When the=
 engine was off, the blades=20
took up only a small percentage of the total arch but with the engine on, t=
here was seemingly no way to=20
know when it was safe to shoot through them. This problem lasted for quite =
a while until a very smart=20
person came up with a very simple solution. By using a small lobed cam on t=
he propeller shaft that=20
controlled a switch on the machine gun, it was possible to stop the gun fro=
m firing only when the cam=20
turned off the switch at the point a bullet might hit the blade. It was so =
simple in fact, the other side=20
only caught on to the idea after one of the planes crashed and they were ab=
le to take it apart.=20

My point is; seemingly very complicated problems often have very simple and=
 ingenious solutions using=20
technology that is already available. The distortion unit is not magic and =
no alien technology was=20
required to make it work. If you could see it, the "smarts" that went into =
designing it will amaze you=20
more than the technology. Heck, the really interesting technology is in the=
 computer.=20

The magnetic field does not require the fantastic energies you might imagin=
e. The field is "created" and=20
captures the singularity inside a very large and powerful specially designe=
d particle accelerator. If the=20
magnetic system failed (which has numerous backups including a system that =
would remove it from this=20
worldline), the singularity would evaporate. Although it is smaller than an=
 electron, it would still be=20
quite undesirable.=20

((why do you keep telling us about the ww3..etc.. how do you know that will=
 even -happen- in our worldline?=20
it may have already been nipped in the bud for all you know..because ours i=
s a different -worldline- from=20
yours!))=20

Yes, you are correct! However, I am not confident things are different enou=
gh for you to avoid the=20

conflict. You may also consider the possibility that a world with no war is=
 far less desirable in the long=20
run. In response to your other point, your assumptions about causality are =
correct but my personal=20
morality still comes into play. I won't deviate from my three rules because=
 of the way I would feel about=20
myself.=20

The singularities do not create Tipler cylinders they create the same physi=
cal environment without all the=20
mass. The same math works for both. There are two singularities. Their mass=
 and spin is altered in order=20
to adjust the size of the ergosphere and cause the event horizons to intera=
ct and create the gravity=20
sinusoid. I have a basic home schooling education (k-12) and a bachelor's d=
egree in history.=20

I will get to the remaining questions soon.=20

First off, the clown who called everyone "sheep" here is out of line. Go BA=
CK and read my posts, CAREFULLY.=20
No one here is a sheep. We are interested in what the guy had to say, becau=
se he made several points, some=20
of them very sound, scientifically.=20

I really detest people like you who go around and make rash assuptions abou=
t "everyone on this list" or=20
another list. You're the same kind of jerk that goes around and tells the m=
edia that "all militia members=20
are a bad", or "guns are a bad thing". The same kind of person that wants p=
eople like "Social Services" to=20
pidgeonhole everyone. Instead of insulting the intelligence of the people w=
ho are here trying to use=20
deductive reasoning to ascertain the truth about someone's means, motive an=
d methods, why don't you go=20
back to your little world and leave the rest of us alone who are trying to =
find out the truth about=20
someone!? Absolute, denial of any possibilities is your bag. Go deny Big Fo=
ot exists, or go deny that the=20
military has an Area 51.=20

Mr. Titor, no, you didn't answer my questions at all regarding singularitie=
s (except that they would=20
'evaporate', or the device would 'remove itself from the time line').=20

In fact, regardless of your background you should have a basic understandin=
g of physics. I'm absoultely=20
CERTAIN that if you're a pilot of an aircraft you ARE an engineer to an ext=
ent in that you understand=20
BASIC PHYSICS of how your aircraft flies.=20

If you're a race car driver, evidence points to the fact that even THEY hav=
e a very good understanding of=20
their cars, engines and the physics thereof.=20

I know for instance that my Jeep is capable of about 198 horsepower. I know=
 that it uses fuel injection.=20

I'm not a mechanic, but I can certainly tell you a great deal about how an =
internal combustion engine=20
works. I can tell you how a bicycle functions (because I used to ride them)=
. I can tell you a good deal=20
about physiology as well - the human body, BECAUSE I HAVE TO KNOW!=20

By the way, I don't remember the "horsepower forumla" off HAND, but I can t=
ell you 1 hp =3D 746 watts. I am=20
an engineer - and I can tell you this much more, if you're a real time trav=
eler from 2036 and time travel=20
is as easy (and as often) as you say it is, and you're in the military or s=
ome government service, then by=20
1) exposing yourself, you've very likely broken several regulations, 2) Put=
 yourself at risk by doing so,=20
3) should know a hell of a lot more about the machines you're operating, 4)=
 are inconsistent in several=20
aspects of your posts.=20

In other words John - you're an apparent fraud. That's too bad, too. These =
people here want to know the=20
truth, they want to believe that there are time travelers, and that perhaps=
 TT would even explain the UFO=20
pheonomenon or other things that are unexplained in the world today. If you=
 were a real person and you=20
have gone so far as to tell us "I'm real, but I don't care if you believe m=
e, in fact I don't want you to=20
believe me"... then you've got a serious problem with reality - not relativ=
ity.=20

By the way, I have some very extreme reasons to doubt that a microsignulari=
ty exists in the first place,=20
and in the second place, if it DID exist, I doubt it would be the "size of =
an electron". In any case, a=20
signularity (a black hole for those of you who haven't figured that out yet=
) is an extreme mass, and=20
holding it in a magnetic field in a gravitational field as strong as Earth'=
s would simply rip the=20
singularity from the magnetic field causing the black hold to crash to the =
center of the mass of Earth.=20

The Earth would then become part of the black hole as it grew in size, pull=
ing in the matter of the Earth.=20

At least that's what physics says. If there are "fail safes" on such a devi=
ce, the device's power would=20
have to be backed up multiple times, and then STILL FUNCTION (to 'rotate th=
e craft out of this time line')=20
to save the existing time line from major problems.=20

Sorry folks, too many holes (not black holes) in this theory.=20

That's right, even a racecar driver has a basic understanding as to the phy=

John, why can't you explain your "time machine" in greater detail?=20

And just for the record the formula for horsepower is something along the l=

John,=20

A couple of questions=20

1. Is the Chevy truck better than the Ford truck for time travel. I always =
thought the TT package meant=20
trailer towing. Geez was I wrong! Is Chevy still making time travel machine=
s in 2036?=20

2. How did you buy your truck? How could you title it if you are only 3 yea=
rs old to the title bureau at=20
this point?=20

You won't be able to sell it in Minnesota unless it's in your name and clea=
r. Is the Chevy newer and how=20
did you pay for it? Did you scrounge around to find 40 year old currency in=
 2036? I know I wouldn't take=20
any money from someone that had mint marks from 2036.=20

3. Does the truck have to be running when you are travelling through time. =
Did you come here in a Chevy?=20
What if you run out of gas? Are there any factory options that make it easi=
er, like cruise control?=20

That's all I can think of for now.=20

Posted by John Titor on 02-13-2001 10:51 AM=20

((l)Have you ever went on any other time traveling missions? If so, what we=
re they?))=20

Yes, but they were all training missions. There is a great deal of psycholo=
gical profiling and testing and=20
one of the training missions involved choosing a time in your life (within =
two years) where you wish you=20
would have done something different and then going back to convince yoursel=
f to do it. The idea is to=20
become familiar with the possibility of meeting yourself which can be rathe=
r difficult. It is quite odd to=20
look at "yourself" and have a conversation. Since any "you" on another worl=
dline would not be a mirror=20
image, you get a slightly distorted feeling while seeing yourself, let alon=

yourself=20


194=20


(2) 1 believe you said you had pictures of your time machine, could you pos=
t a link to uploaded images?=20

I would be happy to do that and I tried a link earlier. I suspect that atta=
ching links to other boards=20

without the Sysop's permission is in bad taste.=20

(3) If you have any pictures of the IBM computer you were susposed to get, =
could you post a link to them=20
also?=20

I'm pretty sure there must be something on the web now about the IBM 5100.=
=20

d couldn't find ANY Titors, is=20

I guess it depends when you look.=20

(5) Can I contact you through any other means of online communications? Lik=
e AOL Instant Messagner? ICQ?=20

MSN? Something so I can have a conversation with you! But if you don't have=
 those, could you possibly=20
consider downloading one of them, then emailing me your user name abcs_123s=
@hotmail.com,nks!=20

I've tried talking online before and found it quite enjoyable but I find th=
e questions and comments come so=20
rapidly its hard to keep up.=20

(6) What is the specific Date that the Nuclear war starts? If you can't rem=
ember the exact date, could you=20
put the month at least? An estimate!=20

I remember the exact date. When it comes, it will not be a surprise.=20

(7) What is the speed of the average computer in the future? I am assuming =
it is in ghZ, if it is higher,=20
could you post the name of that hZ measurement and its relation to the ghZ?=
=20

Ghz is not a useful measurement. Computers are no longer measured by their =
speed as mush as the number of=20
variables (not calculations) they can handle per second.=20

(8) Can you do your own Time Traveling ventures whenever you want? If so, h=
ow much does it cost? Or can you=20
make 'pit stops' along the way back to 2036?=20

No, the unit doesn't belong to me. I can't make stops on the way home as it=
 will throw the gravity=20
measurements off and It would force me to backtrack along the backtrack. Al=
so, I can't just leave and=20
arrive at any place and time I want to. There are physical and technical li=
mits to when and where I can=20
go.=20

(9) Have you ever went past your future, like to 2050 or somewhere around t=
here? If so, what is the world=20
like then?=20

No, I haven't been to the future of my 2036. My profile qualified me for a =
trip to the past.=20

((what about marilyn monroe? i wasn't even born yet when she was alive - bu=
t i know she existed? &amp; telling=20
us something such as her existance would not greatly affect the outcome of =
our entire world.. so why not=20

I understand your position and appreciate your supportive outlook. However,=
 I have given some very detailed=20
information that could be checked out. Please consider that our frame of re=
ference is quite different and=20
finding subjects to discuss and exchange information about could be a chall=
enge. I'm just not up on music,=20
Hollywood and sports in the year 2001. You could ask me all you want about =
1975 but I suspect that's not=20
very impressive.=20

((...but it has nothing to do with his age..))=20

Actually it does, I have never personally experienced this time as an adult=
 and "Brittany Spears" was not a=20
big topic of conversation when your hiking through the swamp. Everything I =
know about your time is from=20
books, magazines and old videotapes that weren't destroyed in the war. If i=
t makes you feel any better, I=20
do struggle with not talking about football.=20

The animal Kingdom is alive and well. I'm sure it suffered but there fewer =
people infringing on animal's=20
habitats now. Nuclear war is a very undesirable thing but it is not the end=
 of the world. There are areas=20
and cities we can't enter and the environment did suffer a great deal of da=
mage but we are recovering.=20
Isn't Hirroshima a thriving city today? The major physical affects include =
skin cancer, infertility,=20
infection, etc. Almost everyone has some sort of physical remnant from the =
war.=20

I am aware the concept of the Rapture is related to Christian Prophecy but =
I am not familiar with the=20
details. Yes, there are people I trust here and I would hate for any harass=
ment or harm to come to them. I=20
am aware of the Mayan Calander but in 2012, it was not something I was able=
 to think about. When the time=20
comes, I'm sure people will find the signs they are looking for that leads =
them to the end of time.=20

When I say fear will keep you alive I am talking about the natural instinct=
s and premonitions that we all=20
trun off when its convienent. The same person who has five dead bolt locks =
on their door will think=20
nothing about getting into a parking garage elevator with a total stranger.=
 I think the fear of God is the=20
fear of separation from God.=20

Some of you may wonder what a time traveler does with his day while he's po=
sting on the web. I spend a=20
great deal of time downloading information and storing it for my return. "A=
rt's" site is definitely on=20
that list. I'll have to think about who the most remembered people are. Aga=
in, my viewpoint is quite=20
squewed.=20

((l)Who is the Major Super Power? ))=20

It depends on how you define power. If you mean military, the world has dev=
eloped into an odd balance.=20

There are plenty of nuclear weapons left but if anyone uses them they will =
be instantly erased from the=20

planet by everyone else regardless of the politics. We are very tired of wa=
r.=20

(2) Are the two political parties still Republicans and Democrats?=20

There are no Republicans or Democrats to speak of. There are now over 10 ma=
jor political parties.=20

(3) How many States are there?=20

The states as you know them still exist but their political power has been =
combined with other states=20
around them. There are now 5 major geopolitical areas in the united states.=
=20

(4) Which states get the worst?=20

When you can't drink the water its bad everywhere.=20

(5) Were only cities along the Eastern Sea port hit in the Nuclear War, or =
all over the country?=20

Mostly cities and large military areas in the entire country.=20

(6) Do companys like Microsoft, Yahoo!, and other internet software company=
s still exist?=20

No.=20

(7) Does money look alot different than it does now? If you have a picture,=
 could you please upload it and=20
post the link!=20

No, money is pretty much the same. Unfortunately, I do not have any money w=
ith me because I wouldn't be=20
able to use it here.=20


195=20


(8) So then when you time travel you can never actually go back to the EXAC=
T same place you left from?=20

That is correct, in physical terms, I can never get back to the exact world=
line I left from.=20

(9) Was alot of the United States' 18-24 age group slaughtered in the war b=
ecause of Draft?=20

Yes.=20

(10) Do you ever get visitors from later time periods to 2036?=20

Not that I'm aware of but I can't say it isn't happening.=20

(11) Are there any other companys, besides the one you work for that have T=
Ts and send them out regularly?=20

I work for the military. GE just makes the unit.=20

(12) Does the government know there is TT going on?=20

In 2036, yes.=20

(13) Why were YOU selected to be a TT? What gave you special qualifications=
?=20

I am related to a key figure in the development of the IBM 5100.=20

(14) How many TTs are there on the team that you are on? How do new recruit=
s get selected?=20

My unit has between 6 and 10. When I left, there were 7 others. Military se=
rvice, physical fitness, history=20

or technical background and special relationship to target contacts get you=
 in the door.=20

(15) What all countrys are on our side in the war? What all countrys are on=
 the oposite side?=20

Don't have much to add there.=20

(16) Which country gets the worst in the war?=20

Again, the entire world is affected. Even if you don't take a direct hit, d=
ying crops and no water can ruin=20

your day.=20

Talking=20

But I will absolutely not get sucked into another "Waverider" hoax.=20

Come on people, don't you remember the Waverider?=20

The Waverider and his fantastic faxes to AB?=20

Well I do.=20

And I admit he suckered me too...for a while.=20

I also remember when he went on the show and made a complete fool of himsel=
f. Art finally came to his=20
senses too and blasted him. It would be nice to find out the date he was on=
 and get a copy of the=20
broadcast.=20

Webmaster? A little help please.=20

Well anyway, back to the subject matter. I don't hate John and I don't disl=
ike him either. I am nuetral=20
about him.=20

There is a world of difference between him and the Waverider though. John h=
as an articulate manner of=20
writing and has an amazing command of our present language (35 years old by=
 him) I also went back and=20
reread ALL his posts and I only found one spelling error and no grammatical=
 errors, so he pretty much=20
shames me on that count. His written content seems to be well subdued and c=
onsistent, (except for the 2004=20
vs. 2005 thing) John seems to be of above average IQ and conducts himself i=
n a dignified manner.=20

Of course all this analysis was made from his posts so he could be an entir=
ely different person in real=20
life.=20

Since I am not completely galvanized against John I have thought about the =
possibility of Human TT. (ET TT=20
is another matter)=20

Logically though the revelation of his TT ability still makes no sense, as =
he could easily question people=20
of this time and get all sorts of info without revealing himself.=20

So that leads to the question why would he reveal himself if he has no stat=
ed aganda for doing so?=20

Some hypothesis:=20

1. John IS a TT'er who has a hidden agenda. It could be as simple as a gent=
le nudge in a certain direction.=20

( It aint gonna happen John, for the most part humans are a stubborn illogi=
cal lot whose memory of past=20
events is in the area of weeks, instead of years or decades)=20

2. John came here to give somebody a "Back to the Future" type of push so a=
s to invent the Time Machine. (=20
My opinion on this is that no one needs to "invent" the TM because if is ha=
s been built in the future then=20
it has always been invented, and we are merely waiting for someone to "disc=
over" it. Just look back at=20
most of the major advancements in science, almost every invention of scienc=
e already existed, it only=20
needed people to put it together.=20

About the only things humans have invented deal in the arts, music etc. Thi=
s opinion comes from the "all=20
times exist at once" theory.)=20

3. John came back for some kind of nostalgia tour and has decided to take a=
 rest stop in 2001 ( don't stay=20
too long John or you will become polluted by us to such an extent you will =
probably end up in Vegas=20
hocking your TM at the tables!)=20

4. John came here to witness some catastrophic near future event and won't =
tell us about it (to me this=20
would be the most plausible reason of them all because whatever he tells us=
 would be rendered mute by the=20
"event")=20

I could be wrong but I don't recall being asked to "explain time travel". I=

So it's ritualized combat on the battlefield of differential geometry. It's=

When I look up debunk, I see: "To expose or ridicule the falseness, sham or=

I cannot debunk your calculations is because they are true. They are not fa=

((There are, however, certain quantities that do remain constant. These con=
stants are related to four=C2=AC=20
dimensional quantities known as metric tensors.))=20

Actually, I don't think that's correct. Minkowski spacetime (4-D) will not =
allow you to use Pythagoas'=20
theorem to decribe tensors because time needs to be expressed with the oppo=
site sign, (please excuse my=20

I conclude that John is:=20

2) He has no time machine.=20

3) He is doing this for personal gain - whether monetary, or social-interac=
tion, but more specifically, I=20
believe he is working on either a psychology study/degree/thesis.=20

4) He is in his late 20's or early 30s.=20

If John were a time traveler, he would not be here telling us anything abou=
t himself. He certainly would=20
not give us information regarding anything having to do with "future techno=
logy", regardless of the=20
divergence of timelines. You see... even a semi-unethical person would have=
 qualms about screwing up a=20
society that you can taste, touch, feel and experience.=20

If John truely IS a time traveler (which he isn't in the sense he is trying=
 to lead us to believe) then he=20
is here to witness an historical event that we have yet to figure out. Eith=
er the beginning of World War=20

of Civil war. I can postulate=20

omething about to happen (very=20
historical, very important...) . If he would answer some questions about th=

ship, I would be willing to go along with this some more.=20

theorem of Pythagoras, a true pillar of all mathematics and physics. The th=
eorem, which is applicable to=20
right angled triangles in flat Cartesian (Newtonian) space takes the form o=
f:=20
c A 2 =3D a A 2 + b A 2=20

where a, b and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.=20

Next we will jump straight to Einstein's theory of Relativity which states =
that neither time, length, or=20
indeed mass remain constant additive quantities when approaching the speed =
of light c. Our simple ideas of=20
time and space come from the fact the we are so used to living in a three d=
imensional universe. Einstein=20
showed that this was simply not true and in fact all the "foundational" thr=
ee laws of Newton have to be=20
fudged by the Lorentz factor=20
L_f =3D (1 - v A 2/c A 2) A -l/2=20

There are, however, certain quantities that do remain constant. These const=
ants are related to four=C2=AC=20
dimensional quantities known as metric tensors. From this Einstein proved t=
hat space and time are two=20
aspects of the same thing and that matter and energy are also two aspects o=
f the same thing. From the=20
second of these concepts we get the most famous equation in physics=20
E =3D me A 2=20

Now since time and space are aspects of space-time and we wish to travel th=
rough time and not build atom=20
bombs we will leave E=3Dmc A 2 for the moment. To illustrate this, look at =
the extension of Pythagorean=20
theorem for the distance, d, between two points in space:=20
d A 2 =3D x A 2 + y A 2 + z A 2=20

where x, y and z are the lengths, or more correctly the difference in the c=
o-ordinates, in each of the=20
three spatial directions. This distance remains constant for fixed displace=
ments of the origin.=20

In Einstein's relativity the same equation is modified to remain constant w=
ith respect to displacement (and=20
rotation), but not with respect to motion. For a moving object, at least on=
e of the lengths from which the=20
distance, d, is calculated is contracted relative to a stationary observer.=
 The equation now becomes:=20
d A 2 =3D x A 2 + y A 2 + z A 2 (l-v A 2/c A 2) A l/2=20

and this implies that the distances all shrink as one moves faster, so does=
 this mean there are no constant=20
distances left in the universe? The answer is that there are because of Ein=
stein's revolutionary concept=20
of space-time where time is distance and distance is time! So now=20
s A 2 =3D x A 2 + y A 2 + z A 2 - ct A 2=20

and this new distance s (remember s stands for Space-time) does indeed rema=
in constant for all who are in=20
relative motion. This distance is said to be a Lorentz transformation invar=
iant and has the same value for=20
all inertial observers. Since the equation mixes time and space up we have =
to always think in terms of=20
this new concept: space-time!=20

Then one runs into the problem of 'outside dating'. Meaning, as the travele=
r manipulates space-time, the=20
rest of the universe ages normaly. Then we must take inter-dimensional tran=
sition into account. Once a=20
hole is ripped into a dimensions fabric, it follows whatever entered the ri=
p. Once the travler enters the=20
new dimension, he commences his engines to reach the c speed (speed of ligh=
t), and travels through time.=20
The rip on the travelers side will stay in the same geographic location, wh=
ile traveling through time,=20
while the rip on the new dimension will follow the traveler. Once the desir=
ed time is reached, the=20
travelar reenters the rip, and he has effectively traveled through time))=
=20

((As for John Titor's corrections on space-time manipulation, he has comple=
ted it correctly. However, he=20
still an imposter.))=20

Apparently, I have made the leap from "fraud" to imposter. At least that's =
a start and I respect my=20

opponent on his polite yet quiet concession on the other thread. I wish to =
emphasize a point I tired to=20
make earlier. Even though I answered the question correctly, it doesn't rea=
lly prove one way or another if=20
I'm a time traveler and you should not think otherwise. I might just be rea=
lly quick at looking up things=20
up on the web.=20

I suppose we could debate whether or not I'm a fraud all the way up to the =
point I leave your worldline.=20

"NEWS FLASH:=20

In case somebody here has not noticed!=20

When was the last time you spoke with someone as intelligent and well verse=
d in these subjects? "=20

Well... last time *1* personally spoke to someone about these subjects who =
is as 'well-versed' was about 30=20
minutes ago when I came from speaking to a couple of physicists upstairs. S=
omehow, I end up speaking to a=20

to do with the job I do for the=20

You're right, however, I don't think we are attacking him, we are QUESTIONI=
NG HIM. Somehow I always see=20

this out of liberally-biased people, when someone is being quizzed, these l=
iberally-biased people complain=20
of attacks when they (or their heros) can't answer questions to someone's s=
atisfaction. He has not=20
answered questions to anyone's satisfaction thus far. He has subjected hims=
elf to our scrutiny and you are=20
jumping to his defense because you feel bad for him? Don't. He put himself =
in this position. He is=20
responsible for the questions, not you.=20

"Let's say that John is a "confused person" would it not be kinder to help =

202=20



Not at all. John is not confused. John is also not a time traveler, but he =
has a fantastic imagination.=20

That much is true. Political correctness is not my forte, nor do I profess =
that anyone use it anymore. It=20
is passe. Sorry. PC is thought control, and being NICE to someone so as not=
 to hurt their feelings is a=20
by-gone thing, of another era.=20

"Let's say he's a hoaxer and really enjoys deceiving everyone and lies all =
the time. Mr. Titor we have a=20
job for you in D.C. after the "Neanderthal" gets voted out in 4 years. "=20

Hmmm... now, you bring me to the point of asking you - why are you now atta=
cking the President of the United=20
States? What has he to do with any of this? Why are you calling him a Neand=
erthal? Because your guy. Gore,=20
lost the election? I'm sorry you feel that way, especially since you seem t=
o think we ought to be nice to=20
John and not attack him (even though we weren't). You thought, more than li=
kely, we should have been nice=20
to Clinton as well. I expect you to act the same way as you expect me to ac=
t. Don't attack the President=20
(in particular since he has nothing to do with this conversation).=20

The one thing I can agree with you that was mentioned, that I didn't quote =
here was the idea of spelling=20
errors, grammer errors and such. I'm certain I have spelling errors. I have=
 almost 21 years of hard-core=20
"schooling" and I make serious spelling errors all the time. That includes =
over 9 years of college,=20
thoughout which, writing was one of the most important aspects. We all make=
 errors, in spelling-=20
judgement. Perhaps we could all be nicer to those of us who make spelling e=
rrors.=20

However, Ernie, when one places himself up for study, as has John, then one=
 needs to understand that there=20
will be questions. These are not attacks (as your crude comments about the =
President of the United States=20
were), but questions concerning his veracity. Question yourself, before you=
 judge others motives. I've=20
questioned MYSELF on whether I should even consider joining this discussion=
. I did so based solely on my=20
inherit need to know about things like time travel. I asked legitimate ques=
tions. They were ignored, then=20
later, when I asked others, they were skirted. John is therefore, either a =
liar, writer or a man who=20
simply doesn't want to get caught in a circle of lies from which he can not=
 extract himself. That is too=20
bad.=20

I really hoped it was the real thing, this time.=20

It was government scientists that decided that Heroin addicts in methadone =

Going to credibility and proof? Just how much is enough for you?=20

If I were to tell you a story that was fantastic in nature and read like a =
science fiction book. This story=20
would relate meetings with high ranking Military officers, DOD operatives. =
The CIA. It dealt with UFO,=20
E.T., global politics, and manipulation of the American press by foreign op=

CIA. Would you believe?=20

I think not.=20

What if you were able to verify that all of the above actually took place b=

documents, addresses, military records, police reports, individual personal=
 validation by witnesses, and=20
the only thing you could not know for sure was what was discussed at these =
meetings.=20

Would you then believe? I doubt it, why? because the actual facts (the conv=

I have lived such a story and I know I could never prove it to anyone's sat=
isfaction, yet it really=20
happened to me, I was nearly killed. I even have permission from the govern=
ment to tell anybody I want=20
because they know there's not a snowball's chance in hell that anyone (that=
 counts)would believe it.=20

I have considered fictionalizing it but it irks me to have to lie so people=
 will take me seriously. Since I=20
don't need the money, and I don't want to have to respond to every question=
 posed to me, intelligent or=20
not, I choose to keep it to myself and my friends.=20

My point is that as hard as you try on this board, there is no way you are =
going to find the truth (about=20
time travel at least)you are looking for until someone pulls up to you in a=
 time machine and takes you to=20
another time.=20

I enjoy a good debate as much as the next guy, and Im prepared to back up a=
ll my statements. I do however=20
require a certain amount of civility to enter into protracted debate, as I =
believe that the moment you=20
lose perspective, the conversation becomes moot.=20

I do feel that some personal attacks are valid. If a person is harming othe=
rs with his statements, and has=20
been "proven" to be dishonest, and malicious in intent.=20

Like the President for instance=20


205=20



I have no problem with anyone taking them on on a personal level. I do it s=
o I would be a hypocrite to=20

Again I appeal to you to e-mail me if you want to carry this any further we=
 are off topic now.=20

I feel my earlier questions were written without much thought. I have read =
all of your posts, and although=20
I don't 'believe', I do find what you are saying very very interesting. I w=

my questions. In hope that it may make it easier for you to answer (feel fr=

e war and then the general way=20
of life after the war. I understand you may not have much information regua=
rding other countries, but I=20
thought I would ask anyway.=20

1) What role does Australia play in the war? You stated elsewhere that they=
 repulse a Chinese invasion -=20
Does this mean Australian government side with your enemy? (As I think I re=
call you stating that they=20
allied with your side + Russia... Could be wrong though.)=20

2) Does intercontinental transportation still exist? If so, have you visite=

 this does appear to be a forum=20
for discussion, I shall try to lend what I can, yes?=20

(Please forgive my lacking grammar, and by all means, don't feel forced to =
read or respond, this is quite=20
lengthy.)=20


206=20



1. You have claimed several times that you will not participate in assistin=
g anyone to get out of 'death by=20
probability'. Yet any number of the things that you have said could have al=
ready caused an individual to=20
do or not do something that will now result in them either dying, or escapi=

It does not matter whether or not everyone believes you. For every statemen=

e to those beliefs. There is no=20
way for you know there is no future world leader reading this and believing=
.=20


2. You claim that you have no interest in proving to us that you are a time=
-traveller. To hear you take=20
such a stance is laughable. Look at what a show you have put on here. Inste=
ad you tell us that you only=20
wish us to make us aware of time-travel as a possiblity (see #1 again), or =
that you only wish to observe=20
us and speak of cultural and religious issues, something interesting to a h=
istorian.=20

You came and posted on this site with one intention that was clear as of yo=
ur first post: to make us=20
believe that you are a time-traveller. You have continued this thread for t=
hat purpose alone, and I find=20
everything you have done supports this.=20

As far as wishing to speak of issues regarding our humanity, or culture, it=
 is quite clear that this is not=20
your intention (contrary to what you insist). If you truly wished to do thi=
s your first line would not=20
have been, 'I am a time-traveller'. If you truly wished to do this you woul=

thread once you realized that line would not serve your claimed goals.=20

You certainly did not expect to examine our humanity or culture by first te=

 you developing your story.=20

This thread that you have continued to participate in has gone entirely cou=

it is obvious that you are knowingl fueling it in that direction.=20


3. "5100 I have now required a couple of special "tweaks" that had to be do=

"We need something portable. The 5100 isn't required for its reliability, i=

I find it very difficult to belive that a software tweak (hence 'software e=
ngineers', -software-) done to a=20
1975 machine could cause it to do this translation more effectively or more=
 portably than something around=20
even today. I find it almost impossible to believe that a tweak done by a '=
software engineer' in 1975=20
could provide for you something that you could find at no other place betwe=

certainly without having to make a stop-over in our time to get back that f=
ar.=20

Furthermore, I find the notion that one of a limited number of time-machine=
s would be used in this manner=20
to be nothing short of nonsensical. There are more effective ways to accomp=

regard.=20


4. I have, and continue to believe Dr. Hawking's view in regards to the pos=
sibility of time travel if=20
indeed the model of time is what you have suggested, that all possibilities=
 occur in different time-lines,=20
in different universes is the way that time truly is. For this reason alone=
 I cannot accept you. It is=20
entirely logical, and I have seen no good case to counter it.=20


You claim that you have no desire to prove your story to us, yet everything=
 you have done from the moment=20
you first posted here has flown in the face of that. As I mentioned before,=
 your desire is so strong that=20
you have even appeared to become heated in manner in reaction to your valid=

What is more, you bring with you the claim that you will tell us no names, =
no locations, or any specifics=20
as a result of your supposed ethics. If those were indeed the ethics you we=
re committed to and reasoned=20
with, you would not be here now.=20

However, I do commend you on engineering your story, as by its very nature =
we cannot prove it false.=20

[I realize that I am only feeding this frenzy, but that speaks for what it =

Hi All=20

I can see why Mr. Titor enjoys this.=20

You guys are pretty passionate about your beliefs. Then again, that's what =
its all about.=20

Going over a few of the posts, and I say that they are full of the classica=
l - "I find it hard to believe,=20
therefore I declare it to be impossible" - types of postulates. I can see t=
he levels you are defining, in=20
some cases, - and I can see that they are encompassed in possibilities you =
are not considering=20

Ex.=20

=E2=80=94I find it very difficult to belive that a software tweak (hence 's=
oftware engineers', -software-) done to=20
a 1975 machine could cause it to do this translation more effectively or mo=
re portably than something=20
around even today. I find it almost impossible to believe that a tweak done=
 by a 'software engineer' in=20
1975 could provide for you something that you could find at no other place =
between now and 'your time',=20
and certainly without having to make a stop-over in our time to get back th=
at far. =E2=80=94=20

Also, Ryan - I think John has provided some explanation regarding how posit=
ionings are affected by the mass=20
and gravity of known OBJECTS. I would have to study the posts a little more=
 carefully, though I would say=20
that the variables used in computing projected postionings, rely heavily on=
 detecting these known masses=20
as opposed to trying to figure out where they would end up in space (and ti=
me).=20

One of the first assumptions I would discard is that physics suppositions a=
re "either/or" proposals. My=20
view (with a few years under my belt), is that things work more fluidly tha=
n that.=20

In viewing the following models take into consideration that the degrees I =
am talking about, are minuscule=20
with respect to their effects on human activity - that's why the "10%-15%" =
divergence over some 60 years,=20
sounds OK to me.=20

If you looked at a weather system of HIGH and LOW pressures, and fronts, yo=
u would see isobaric "circles"=20
that delineate common weather areas. Correlate these fields, as local "area=
s" or "eras" of time. Again the=20
differences regarding how fast time "moves" in these "circles", would be sl=
ight and perhaps unnoticeable.=20
They would be enough, though, to provide "circles of common interaction" an=
d (significantly, I believe),=20
would also provide some sort of common playing field or "fabric" - for all =
the individuals within that=20
area. Moving into other regions or circles, would be fluid transistions (as=
 opposed to "either/or"=20
transistions). I believe such a move would also precipitate new experiences=
. You might then have to deal=20
with, what Terrence McKenna termed "DEGREES OF NOVELTY AND HABIT". Moving i=
nto other "topographical=20
areas", you would also have to "shift gears" ... your "sense of timing" wou=
ld be a bit off, until you either=20
found some groove of activity that you could fall into, or until you could =
create new ways of "being" and=20
acting, to handle the new circumstances. The effects of novelty could be no=
ticed in little things like=20
misteps and mistakes, or unintended synchronicities that might seem to alte=
r your path. The effects of=20
falling into normal routines would soon cause your new environment to loose=
 its "newness".=20

Similarly, a geo-topological map (rings of altitudes) works the same in dep=
icting (minor) GRAVITATIONAL=20
fields. Again, I would think the degrees in gravitational differences, woul=
d be unnoticeably present,=20
though present non-the-less.=20

Within these geographical "circles" of time, and gravitational pulls, peopl=
e work out certain local and=20
global destinies and intentions. These then cumulate into cultural topologi=
es.=20

Given this model, the "degrees of separation" can only have extended effect=
s depending on the=20

interactivities of field compontents (you and me, or even other living thin=
gs). John's interactions on=20
these boards probably have little effect on what's going on in a small scho=
ol room in the Ukraine, or a in=20
hospital grieving area outside of Tokyo, at this very moment. They might ha=
ve more of an effect on how you=20
handle you're work day after spending a morning reading posts, though. They=
 might even have an effect on=20
how a co-worker or fellow commuter handles their evening after they've been=
 around you.=20

Discussions regarding such potential realities do seem to be a good way to =
get people to think - Its about=20
time, after all &lt;g&gt;.=20

Posted by Lee Heggy on 02-15-2001 08:31 AM=20

It's very possible to calculate such coordinates but you have to have a ref=
erence point to start from that=20
is static in relation to the motion of the solar system and the rest of the=
 universe. We know what=20
direction we are moving in. You merely have to plot the points along that l=
inear track. You would also=20
want to be very careful and exact or you would end up inside of a cow or wo=

Actually, Ryan, that isn't true.=20

I can, given the right software not only calculate the specific location of=
 the earth 30 years ago, where=20
it will be thirty years hence.=20

Based on the presumption that the sun is sitting still you can calculate th=
e precise location of the earth=20
at any time.=20

Given that the above is not true - that is the sun is traveling through spa=
ce at several thousand miles per=20
second, as well, as the planets moving about it, and the entire arm of the =
galaxy in which we reside is=20
moving as well... it is more difficult, BUT not impossible.=20

As Captain Kirk once said to his crew after the battle with Khan, "he is th=
inking in two dimensions only"...=20
we are thinking in three only. The fourth, time, is traveling away from us =
as precisely the same rate as=20
it was a few moments ago. Given this we can calcuate the exact location bas=
ed on several factors, knowing=20
the current location of the sun, the past location of the sun and then figu=
ring the future location of the=20
sun.=20

Given this, we know that our Eart travels in an ellipse around the sun at a=
 given speed over 365.25 days=20
per year. That tells us the Earth will be in a specific location 30 years f=
rom now.=20

Personally, I've taken tracking programs meant for satellites and calulated=
 the projected location of Near=20
Earth Asteroids several times. If *1* can do it, certainly an advanced comp=
uter from the future can figure=20
out where we are now.=20

Mr. Murphy =E2=80=94=20

If you are standing still on the surface of the earth, does the earth move =
away from you as the years=20
progress?=20

It is not neccesary to calculate and then adjust for the exact location of =
the earth realitive to some=20
static frame of reference like the center of the galaxy or some magic 'orig=
in' point. Everything is=20
relative. A TT blessed with a TT-device capable of traveling through time w=
hile standing still relative to=20
the earth wouldn't have to worry much about where the earth would be 30 yea=
rs into the future =E2=80=94 because he=20
and his device are already moving in such a way that he will be in the same=
 place 30 years down the time=20
axis.=20

Of course this is assuming that einstien's physics was at least accurate en=
ough for such purposes. That is=20
yet to be proven, but it has held strong for more than half a=20

My Motive:=20

I've been in your time a bit longer than I had expected. My next opportunit=

spring. For most of my adult life, I have read about, wondered and debated =
about this time. I value this=20
opportunity to share experiences. If you absolutely believed I was a time t=
raveler, with no skepticism=20
whatsoever, then we would be unable to communicate. The focus of our attent=
ion would then always be on the=20
machine. The experiences, opinions and reasons you do things are just as va=
lid as mine and just as=20
different. I hope to return home with a better understanding of why you thi=
nk and believe the way you do.=20
Although I do understand the reasons for asking, I won't gain from any comm=
unication with you by spouting=20
physics formulas and pop culture predictions. Please do not assume I am pur=
posely avoiding questions. I am=20
human, I get tired, and I forget things. Please, just remind me if I missed=
 a question and I will get to=20
it.=20

I do have one tip though. If you want me to go over your post in detail put=
, "Hey John, you're a big Jerk."=20
at the end of the insightful and logical part, not the beginning. In fact, =
maybe you could just abbreviate=20

Earth time. This type of "time travel" (should have been proven already on =
this worldline) with atomic=20
clock experiments. With sufficient power, this type of time travel will onl=
y provide practical=20
displacement in a future direction. This type of time travel is also isolat=
ed to a single worldline. You=20
will not meet yourself.=20

GRAVITY =3D ACCELERATION=20

As Einstein pointed out with his STR, the effects of gravity and accelerati=
on are the same. Therefore, you=20
will experience the same time travel effects in the twin paradox by being c=
lose to a large gravity source.=20
In the atomic clock experiments mentioned above, the reason there was a dif=
ference in time was not because=20
the clock in the plane was moving, it was because the clock in the well was=
 closer to the center of the=20
Earth. Constant speed is not acceleration.=20

LARGE GRAVITY =3D STATIC BLACK HOLE=20

The next step is to find a large gravity source to use in your time machine=
. Static black holes provide=20
this type of power. As one twin approaches the event horizon or edge of the=
 black hole, the other twin=20
will watch him as he appears to slow down. He will notice his twin's watch =
run slower until it stops at=20
the event horizon. The twin moving toward the horizon will notice none of t=
his and see his watch running=20
just fine. Although possible, a trip into a static black hole will not take=
 you to another worldline and=20
it's one-way. The force of gravity will crush you.=20


210=20


ROTATING BLACK HOLE =3D DONUT-SHAPED SINGULARITY=20

Fortunately, most black holes are not static. They spin. Spinning black hol=
es are often referred to as Kerr=20
black holes. A Kerr black hole has two interesting properties. One, they ha=
ve two event horizons and two,=20
the singularity is not a point, it looks more like a donut. These odd prope=
rties also have a pronounced=20
affect on the black hole's gravity. There are vectors where you can approac=
h the singularity without being=20
crushed by gravity. (For those interested in seeing a graphic of a photon t=
rip through a Kerr black hole,=20
try here)=20

http://qso.lanl.gov/~bromley/nu_nofun.html=20

DONUT-SHAPED SINGULARITY =3D PASSAGE INTO ALTERNATE WORLDLINE=20

Another other more interesting result of passing through a donut singularit=
y is that you travel through=20
time by passing into another universe or worldline. Please see Penrose diag=
rams for Kerr Black holes or=20
you can examine the calculations of Frank Tipler.=20

So now the problem becomes....where do we find a donut-shaped singularity?=
=20

A PONDERING HAWKING =3D MICROSINGULARITY=20

Steven Hawking proposed the existence of microsingularities that were creat=
ed in the big bang. They were=20
probably about the size of a proton and disappeared over the years due to a=
n effect of radiation=20
evaporation. (Yes, black holes do emit energy.)=20

HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS =3D ARTIFICIAL MICROSINGULARITY=20

When I first started posting online a few months ago, I said that major bre=
akthroughs in particle physics=20
were around your corner. Soon, CERN will bring their big machine on line an=
d they will be smashing very=20
fast and high-energy particles together. One of the more odd and potentiall=
y dangerous items produced from=20
this incease in energy will be microsingularities a fraction of the size of=
 an electron, (for those who=20
would like to follow the developments at CERN)=20
http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html=20
ARTIFICIAL MICROSINGULARITY =3D LOCALIZED KERR FIELD=20

Through trial and error, and although they are quite heavy, hot and capable=
 of putting out a great deal of=20
energy (300 - 500 megawatts), it's discovered that these microsingularities=
 can be electrified and=20
captured. It is also interesting to note at this point that electrified sin=
gularities also have two event=20
horizons. By spinning these various microsingularities, a localized Kerr fi=
eld is created.=20

LOCALIZED KERR FIELD =3D TIPLER SINUSOID=20

By using two microsingularites in close proximity to each other, it is poss=
ible to create, manipulate and=20
alter the Kerr fields to create a Tipler gravity sinusoid. This field can b=
e adjusted, rotated and moved=20
in order to simulate the movement of mass through a donut-shaped singularit=
y and into an alternate world=20
line. Thus, safe time travel.=20

I will continue with the individual posts next. Thank you for your patience=

(2) . I will not disclose any detailed information that would allow someone=

 to do that.=20

((Do you feel some pleasure in breathing clean air and not having to check =

Yes I do. However there is a fear about being here that I can only define a=

around in 2001, the air smells clean but I wonder if it really is. In 2036,=
 there is no gray. The air is=20

((2. John came here to give somebody a "Back to the Future" type of push so=

((4) What exactly happens to the water? does it get poisoned from radiation=

Yes, radiation affected the water but that can always be distilled out. The=

Yes. I am with them now. I would say it's a combination of fear and relief.=

((7) Lets just say that people from the future are manipulating events now,=

happen in one of these situations?))=20

Based on my understanding of time, manipulation of your worldline by future=
 time travelers would have no=20
affect on their original or home worldline. If that is happening, it must b=

John,=20

I want you to understand something - since you're using our discussions to =
make a determination of our=20
thinking for when you go back. Understand that I don't think you're a jerk,=
 but I believe you to be a=20
"false time traveler" at this point. HOWEVER, I will say that you took the =
time to post some information=20
that DOES answer some of my questions. Your disertation on physics (at leas=
t in a small way) confirms a=20
few things that I think are relatively accurate.=20

Are the pictures (at the URL I posted a couple days ago) YOUR pictures of y=
our time machine?=20

(http://pub2.ezboard.com/fmagisystemstimelordsanonymus.showMessage?topicID=
=3D53.topic)=20

I'm going to help John answer a question that someone else asked. "What wou=
ld the DOD do to you if they=20
found you out?"=20

John would be grabbed by government federal agents and held incognito until=
 a determination could be made=20
based on national security. He certainly would be at risk of his life in "a=
ll probability" because he IS=20
(will be/was - put in any decriptors based on tense you wish) a threat to n=
ational security in "our time".=20

Here is why. John claims to come from a different time, our future time act=
ually. Even though it is perhaps=20
a different time thread, or time line, he could affect the outcome of our o=
wn future either through active=20
participation or negligent participation. In other words, Johns actions cou=
ld conceivable make a=20
difference what happens. This is the main reason he is following some very =
specific "non interference"=20
doctrine.=20


214=20



The very fact that John has made himself "visible" to the users here makes =
him a target. Believe it or not=20
- *1* work for the government. I work in an area that, while my particular =
job has nothing to do with=20
this, am extremely interested in his statements. Yes - we in the government=
 DO watch for things like this.=20
However, rest assured, if I went to the security office and said "I have ac=
cess to a time traveler" I'd=20
get laughed at. I'd have to get in touch with the "right people" to "report=
" the incident, and even then=20
the skeptics would over rule the "believers".=20

What this means is, even though John could be consider a national security =
threat, he certainly is safer=20
than even me, who works daily in government facilities.=20

Now that I have admitted my "government participation" let me tell you MY m=
otive. Time travel. Afew days=20
ago, someone sent me a copy of a time travel ad. I was intrigued by this. T=
he ad, mysteriously appeared on=20
Art Bells site last night. (Go there and look at it - you will see precisel=
y what I saw). I have drafted a=20
letter indicating I'm interested. Yes, I have my own weapons (and a family,=
 grandkids and kids ) but... if I=20
had a chance to go back in time, I would take it. Assuming I could get back=
. haha.=20

My problem is that I would "interact" I believe. I would find the idea of i=
nteraction almost irresistable,=20
which I would assume is one of the things psychologists would have a proble=
m with time travelers in any=20
case.=20

The US government... Russian or any other, would be in the same boat. They =
would, if they could believe it,=20
GRAB and hold time travelers - checking the veracity of their stories and p=
reventing them from having any=20
interaction with anyone.=20

Sound about right John?=20

I have a distinct feeling that I want to "believe" that John is truly a tim=
e traveler. The reason is simple=20
and probably selfish. I have always said I want to live to see the ripe old=
 age of 200. I MIGHT make it to=20
150 given todays medical advancements. If so, I have around 107 years to go=
. I can't wait to see what the=20
future holds.=20

I want to LIVE time though, I don't want to go to the future and not be abl=
e to get back to my family and=20
friends. I want to see that something so fantastic and so outlandish that i=

come true.=20

Those are MY motives for being here, chatting about this.=20

Granted, there are deeper, more scientific discussions on other boards and =
elsewhere in the scientific=20
community, but they are "deeper" than I wish to delve. John has given me at=
 least that tiny hope that=20
somewhere out there, on some time line, someone will indeed do what we've b=
een believing all along.=20

So - John, my comments about being fraudulent - please don't take them seri=
ously and please do not think I=20
have anything against you personally, nor wish to discredit you. I only wan=
t the honest truth.=20

If you tomorrow, said, Rick, this was an experiment in psychology, writing,=
 or fantasy - whatever, I would=20
not be surprised. If I had a way to prove you were truly a time traveler - =
that secret would be safe with=20
me (as would anything else you told me). See, I believe in America, and I b=
elieve in Freedom.=20

I believe if you're really what you say you are - then you're a hope for th=
e future. Even if there is=20
'civil war' or nuclear war - people like myself are already prepared for th=

Whatever comes of this... best of luck in either your studies in psychology=

Thumbs up=20

Hi Rick, John, all:=20

I also found John's post regading the specifics to be beyond much contentio=
n. My scale is tipping toward=20
belief.=20

I'll say this much. The descriptions John provided are much more convincing=
 than his ability to write a=20
given equation. I think I understand why Rick was impressed as I know a bit=
 more about Rick today than I=20
did 2 days ago I mean his technical background.=20

Here is my opinion.=20

John thus far has demontrated the following:=20

Ability to discuss physics that seems to rise (eventually) to the level of =
the question posed.=20

High degree of intelligence.=20

Has not wavered in his ethical assertions regarding (verifyable) disclosure=
 of future events.=20

No interest in making money for this (so far)=20

Continuity of statements (not 100%, but he's human)=20

Accurate cultural behaviour for a person from the world he claims to come f=
rom.=20

Has "I believe" made more than 1 verifyable prediction. (I think) correct m=
e if I misunderstood his post.=20

Patience=20

A degree of loyalty to his country, and for democracy not found every day. =
He has read the Constitution and=20
understood it. IMHO=20

Hinted that he may have had something to do with recent events that did not=
 come to pass.=20

An accurate depiction of the climate that would escalate to the wars and ev=
ents he describes.=20

Made statements that contradict many other Time Traveller's=20

Statements.=20

Has attempted to answer most of what is asked of him.=20

The ability to accurately relate a story as if he had been there.=20

A great deal of self control when "questioned".=20

(for you Rick=20

In general has been a very good thread host.=20

None of this proves he's a time traveller, but it does prove to me that I s=
hould continue to read the=20
posts, and ask further question.=20

As someone recently mentioned a preponderance of circumstantial evidence bu=
ilds credibility.=20

I have a question for John:=20

John, what would it take to get you to stick around after spring and leave =
during the next window of=20
opportunity?=20

I fear that another month or 2 may not be enough time to get as much said a=
nd discussed as I would like to=20
have.=20


215=20



Regarding the photos. I have asked 6 friends that have been in the military=
 and "whatever" the device is in=20
the photo looks very authentic. The manual also is what you would expect fr=
om the military. The revisions=20
on the cover page look normal for such a manual. Maybe Rick can take a clos=
e look at the photos. Has=20
anyone done any imaging on the photos to make the individual controls on th=
e "machine" more visible.=20

In your "world time" have things like "Saquatch" , "Loch Ness monster", and=
 other reported unusual animals=20
been seen, or captured or explained away.=20

Is remote viewing used to gather military intelligence?=20

Are psychics still common? are they used by the government?=20

Is there a Police Dept as we know it. Have any of your top leaders or polit=
icians been jailed or impeached?=20

John, any chance of getting a better set of photos with more of the manual?=
.=20

John please respond to my question as to "the prediction" did I jump the Gu=
n? (get ahead of myself).=20

One final question? Is there a Global Superpower state and what nation is i=
t.=20

Best regards,=20

I think I understand. I guess you are held accountable, in some way, for ch=

period. You would know, and I guess no one else has to. Let me see if I get=
 this. You tell me about a new=20
cultural fad - for instance, let's say Czech Dance Wear, becomes chic. I ke=
ep my eye on trends, and=20
invest, in a way that benefits me, at the exclusion of someone else. OR I o=

trend and then trend burns out sooner than it otherwise would. Then you, on=
 your time-line, notice, when=20
you get back, that the weekly dance at the local Youth Hall is no longer ce=
ntered around Czech Bouncing,=20
for the summer of '36. Instead, for some quirky reason. Cowboy Line Dancing=
 appeals to everyone for a few=20
weeks or months during this period. Otherwise everything else remains relat=
ively unchanged.=20

Please answer this question to the best of your ability to assist us. I'm a=
 big believer in grassroots=20
resourcefulness, and its power in creating discerning situations that test =
people's willingness and=20
ability to make their own way.=20

It seems to me that with the cities under such stresses, people would flock=
 in large numbers to remote=20
areas like Winnipeg (sorry guys) or some other region with plenty of clean =
water, air and soil. Why is=20
this such a nelected fix? I would also imagine that the network of Intentio=
nal Communities (communes?)=20
that took root over the years, would provide infrastructural support to a n=
ation needing to find its=20
"FOXFIRE" roots.=20

If I was transposed to the 1920's or 30's, you would have a hard time keepi=

public places, shops, concert halls, etc. just trying to take it all in. Di=

It is interesting to note that the photos posted on that other site were po=
sted by an "anonomyous time=20
traveler" some time back. It fits the exact description John has give us of=
 his machine. Therefore, based=20
on his discription alone, I would say he is the one that posted the picture=
s. If he didn't post them, then=20
he is using them for the basis of his story.=20

Regardless of the two supositions above, the device appears to be "authenti=
c" to me. I have some experts=20
looking at the manual and the pictures as well - for obvious reasons, I won=
't tell you who because they=20
aren't aware of this discussion and I don't intend to tell them about it.=
=20

I am extremely familiar with military spec equipment in many forms, more sp=
ecifically communications=20
systems of various types. I have never seen this particular item (in my tim=
e... ) nor anything vaguely=20
resembling it. HOWEVER, it does have the look and feel of a piece of gear p=
roduced by a large corporation=20
for the military.=20

John - in looking closely at this device, I see there is a hand control uni=
t - with some sort of screen on=20
it. I assume this is the computer interface through which the device is pro=
grammed (or time settings are=20
made). Is that an accurate assumption? What does the display show you (for =
instance, does it simply show=20
things like time/date calculations, or radiation [probably wrong word] of t=
he fields from the device?)=20

Also, there are 16 apparent buttons. I have to assume further that these ar=
e multifunction keys (that is=20
you press one for an alt/control function and other buttons have names or l=
abels and perhaps even=20
numerical meanings). Is that also accurate?=20

At the very begginning of this thread, I was very skeptical. Who wouldn't b=

I find myself believing it even more with each page. What I find strange is=
 why so many people don't=20
believe. I think we've established that a majority of us do believe time tr=
avel a possibility. Most of us=20
also believe that the human race does indeed learn how to travel to time so=

believe this, then why do we find it so hard to believe that there are peop=

John is not a time traveler, then he's a **** good lier. There are minor fl=
aws in his stories, but I think=20
there are more strengths than flaws. Maybe I just believe his story because=
 I want to (selective belief).=20

As for the issue of security, I think Rick covered it all. I don't think th=

minded to this topic as some of us. Unless John proved he was a time travel=

be using his IP to track him. Which is a reason I don't think John can be p=

Mr. Vega and Mr. Hendrickson:=20

The wonderful ability for the human mind to group things by simularities, g=

stories heard in the past exists.=20

But it is not conclusive proof of the falsity of anybodies claims.=20

I, as an attempted-authorer (pretty simular to being an attempted-murderer)=
, have ran into the 'universal=20
hero myth' dillema face to face, in mental combat to the death . . . and ha=
ve yet to arrise victorious . .=20
. but it does not mean I have no good stories to tell, nor that they are un=
original. And it certainly=20
doesn't mean that any story I may come up with is most definetly not true .=
 . .=20

I am fairly certain that proving anything is impossible. (By this I mean pr=
oving ABSOLUTELY . . . within=20

certain frameworks, like mathematics, things can be proven . . . but in gen=
eral? I think not. In what we=20

call 'reality'? I also think not. Life would be too simple.)=20

If this is true, and I think it is, it also follows that it is impossilbe t=
o disprove anything =E2=80=94 although=20
the two are often different problems.=20

So the ongoing 'discussion' about the veracity of this TT's claims is large=

Hi all:=20

Randy, although I remain to be convinced as to the nature of John or his st=
ory. I have never said he was a=20
fake or a fraud, or a liar, actually, I expressed frustration at the seemin=
gly all important "is he or=20
isn't he" debate.=20

I propose that "what John is" is irrelevant to this conversation. What is r=
elevant is the ideas, and very=20
good technical information being discussed here. I can tell you that I'm su=
re that some of the posters=20
know more about time travel and it's why's and why nots, than they did prio=
r to coming here.=20

The real interesting conversation has been about the culture he describes, =
and the way they approach life.=20

My comment regarding story lines is accurate. It does not however, detract =
from any literary work. It also=20
had no connection to John Titor, I was actually disagreeing with the previo=
us poster that stated that the=20
Farmer General metaphor somehow was indicative of deception on Johns part, =
or a weak link in his story.=20

The Farmer General is nothing new. History is replete with Farmer Generals.=
=20

I was pointing out to him the "preponderance" of similarity that exists in =
the area of "plot development".=20
As an author you must have at times asked yourself if the scene you were cr=
eating did not sound too much=20
like "this", or "that".=20

Anyway, I just wanted to clarify the point.=20

Oh one more thing.=20

You say=20

The mind is the ultimate vessel for any kind of exploration . . . lets plea=
se direct our miranderings a=20

Please excuse me if I misuderstood but neither I nor anyone else here is go=

any direction to please "your" sense of Aesthetics.=20

As soon as you become a moderator here you can dictate whatever you want. R=
emember that whatever you post=20

By the way "effective meandering" is a poor choice of metaphor, you see it'=

People who posit theories of time travel generally write in terms of time t=

with very short trips - the kind that early experimenters would most likely=
 attempt (to avoid divergence=20
problems if nothing else).=20

In this experiment the traveller only goes 30 seconds into the past to appe=
ar in his lab. It seems that 30=20
seconds before his experiment was to begin he saw himself apppear in the la=
b. There would now be two=20
travellers and two time machines. It doesn't appear that it ends that simpl=
y as the "second" time=20
traveller says that he saw a duplicate self appear in the lab thirty second=
s before he started the trip.=20

It would appear that its a time loop and an infinite number of duplicates s=
ee a duplicate self appear in=20
the lab thirty seconds prior to the start of the trip.=20

Your time machine weighs 500 lbs and an average man weighs about 180 lbs. S=
o lets say that that the mass is=20
about 700 lbs per traveller. What is the mass of the duplicates and where d=
id the mass come from? What is=20

It may intrest you to read some of the other threads on this bbs, the ones =
about other topics, like=20
religion . . . and post in them.=20

But I think I can provide a brief response to your questions to promote fur=
ther conversation here.=20

I believe that faith AND good works will get one to God. There are other th=
ings, but they can arguably be=20
included under the headings of 'faith' and 'good works'.=20

I believe there is an organized force of evil that works against God's plan=
 for men's souls. Its all part=20
of the plan.=20

Your next question may be "Why do you believe that?" . . .=20

My answer is two part:=20

1. I was born into a family where such beliefs run strong. It feels right t=
o believe what my loved ones=20
believe.=20

2. My studies since my childhood have done nothing but confirm that such be=
liefs are at least well founded,=20

if not indicated by the way I understand that 'things' work in this reality=
. By this I allude to many=20
different avenues of the pursuit of knowledge. Recently, the most convincin=
g has been things I've learned=20
in my study of physics, of all things . . .=20

Some scientist say science has made them athiests ... I say science, as I u=
nderstand it, has had the=20
opposite effect on many others.=20

I like to think, and the more I think, the more I become convinced that my =
beliefs are accurate enough for=20
my purposes.=20

But, they are beliefs, and I could not prove them to you.=20

Another reason why I am stubborn in some of these beliefs, the religious on=
es and other parts of my=20
philosophy is because it feels right =E2=80=94 almost as if by intuition or=
 subconscious communications from 'the=20
other side'.=20

I don't think the possibility of TT disagrees in any way with any of the el=
ements of my philosophy.=20

of your philosophy, John.=20

aight? (I'll look over the past=20

posts of course, but reiteration doesn't hurt.) How would you answer your o=
wn questions?=20

Could you talk a bit more on how the 'many worlds' view point introduced by=
 the advent of the TT tech,=20
developed in your society affects the religious views of both the masses an=

I think that it works with the way I understand things =E2=80=94 Falling un=

Hi John:=20

Best I could find is from the Hebrew Ha-Satan, or "the Adversary."=20

First, let's examine what the Bible reveals about the origin of Satan and t=
he demons.=20

EZEKIEL 28:12 "Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, and =
say to him, 'Thus says the Lord=20
GOD: "You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty=
. 13 You were in Eden, the=20
garden of God; every precious stone was your covering: The sardius, topaz, =
and diamond, beryl, onyx, and=20
jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald with gold. The workmanship of your=
 timbrels and pipes was=20
prepared for you on the day you were created. 14 You were the anointed cher=
ub who covers; I established=20
you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked back and forth in the=
 midst of fiery stones. 15 You=20
were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was =
found in you. 16 By the=20
abundance of your trading [rekullatek] you became filled with violence with=
in, and you sinned; therefore I=20
cast you as a profane thing out of the mountain of God; and I destroyed you=
, 0 covering cherub, from the=20
midst of the fiery stones. 17 Your heart was lifted up because of your beau=
ty; you corrupted your wisdom=20
for the sake of your splendor . . ." (NKJV)=20

REVELATION 12:3 And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great, fiery=
 red dragon having seven heads=20
and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads. 4 His tail drew a third of t=
he stars of heaven and threw=20
them to the earth. . . . (NKJV)=20

LUKE 10:17 Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demo=
ns are subject to us in Your=20
name." 18 And He said to them, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven=
." (NKJV)=20

From the preceding Scriptures, we can learn several things about Satan and =
the fallen angels. In the=20
beginning, this "anointed cherub" was created as a wise, beautiful, and pow=
erful angel. He apparently was=20
one of the two cherubs who cover the mercy seat (God's throne) with their w=
ings (see Heb. 8:5; 9:5, 23-24;=20
Exo. 25:20; 37:9; I Kin. 6:19-28; 8:6-7; I Chr. 28:18; II Chr.3:10-13; 5:7-=
8). However, because of pride=20
in his beauty, this cherub's wisdom was corrupted.=20

Satan is symbolically called the "king of Tyre" (Eze. 28:12). The coastal c=
ity-state of Tyre was one of the=20
world's greatest traders during Israel's monarch period. Isaiah calls Tyre =
"the bestower of crowns, whose=20
merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of the earth" (Isa. =
23:8).=20

Although the Scriptures don't define the trade Satan was engaged in, it cle=
arly tells us that because of=20
the abundance of his trade, he sinned. Possibly Satan implemented a system =
of competition rather than=20
cooperation, which eventually filled him with violence, causing his iniquit=
y.=20

The word rendered "trading" in the NKJV translation of Ezekiel 28:16 is a f=
orm of the Hebrew noun rekulla,=20
which means "traffic" or "merchandise." This particular form of rekulla is =
only found five times, all in=20
Ezekiel (Eze. 26:12; 27:20, 23; 28:16, 18).=20

However, rekulla is derived from the root word rakal. It's relevant to note=
 that a closely-related=20
derivative, rakil, means "slanderer." It's used in this context six times (=
Lev. 19:16; Jer. 6:28; 9:4;=20

Eze. 22:9; Pro. 11:13; 20:19). The account of Satan in Ezekiel 28 could wel=
l involve aspects of both these=20
meanings. In the New Testament, this fallen angel is often called the "devi=
l," or the diabolos in the=20
Greek (Matt. 4:1, 5, 8, 11; 13:39; 25:41; Luke 4:2, 3, 6, 13; 8:12; John 8:=
44; 13:2; Acts 10:38; 13:10;=20
Eph. 4:27; 6:11; I Tim. 3:6, 7; II Tim. 2:26; Heb. 2:14; Jam. 4:27; I Pet. =
5:8; I John 3:8, 10; Jude 9;=20
Rev. 2:10; 12:9, 12; 20:2, 10). Not coincidentally, the literal meaning of =
diabolos and its variations is=20
"slanderer."=20

It's possible that through his "slander" and "gossip," Satan turned one-thi=
rd of the angelic host against=20
God. We know that Satan tried this approach in the Garden of Eden, when he =
misrepresented God's motives to=20
Eve (Gen. 3:1-5). The angelic forces loyal to God eventually had to cast th=
is "anointed cherub," along=20
with his allies, out of heaven. From that point forward he became known in =
Hebrew as Ha-Satan, or "the=20
Adversary."=20

There is more e-mail me if anyone wants the rest=20

sincerely,=20
pamela=20

I know John is busy archiving and I am going to help him out on this one be=
cause he has already answered=20
the last couple of questions you had. I am sure he will appreciate it. here=
 you go Rick:=20

Pamela: l.What exactly would an observer see as they saw you arriving in th=
is=20
time? and exactly what would they see as you departed? would you just appea=
r=20
suddenly or slowly? would you look like a heat mirage for awhile? any=20
light effects? or hazy misty shimmering distortion?=20


227=20




Time travel_0- The observation of time travelers "appearing" suddenly in a =
world line do not happen very=20
often. There are two cases and two points of view to consider. In the first=
 case, the time machine does=20
not move as it goes from one world line to another and then returns. The pe=
ople watching on the original=20
world linewould wave good bye and watch as the machine is turned on.=20

There would be a static discharge and the air would appear to "ripple" as i=
f it were getting denser. Then,=20
it would stop and the machine will have appeared to have gone no where. If =
the machine doesn't move its=20
position from world line to world line, the observer would not see it disap=
pear at all. In the second=20
case, if the machine is moved, it would disappear from the viewpoint of the=
 observer and return in a=20
different location based on where it was moved and turned on from the desti=
nation world line. In that=20
case, the rippling seems to dissolve the machine and it disappears. If that=
 happens while you are watching=20
it leave and you expect it to return, you know it was moved or had a seriou=
s malfunction. It is actually=20
quite dangerous to get too close to a distortion unit as it enters or leave=
s a world line. It vents=20
radiation and has a very strong localized gravity field. Personally, I worr=
y about that a great deal.=20

Pamela:2.What is the dimension of the field around the car? How many feet o=
ut from the car would you say it=20
goes?=20

Timetravel_0-lt can be adjusted to some degree. The CG (center of gravity) =
is adjustable within about 4=20
feet and the unit is effective about 10 to 12 feet in either direction from=
 there. The vertical distance=20
is quite a bit shorter and is determined by sensors in the unit.=20

Pamela:3.approximately in inches how much of the ground is taken with you i=
n one trip?=20

timetravel_0-Depending on weather or not you are going forward or backward,=
 the footprint of the unit is=20
different. I wouldn't quite say it "scoops" up the ground cleanly. It sort =
of vibrates it loose and takes=20
it along for the ride. It looks like someone raked the ground an inch or so=
 deep with a small hand hoe or=20
shovel. The negative ergosphere "scoops" up the front and back areas of the=
 field. The positive ergosphere=20
leaves a longer area near the center of mass. Its about a cubic foot of dir=
t spread out over six square=20
feet or so.=20

Pamela:4.If they put the device in a house and turned it on what do you thi=
nk would happen?=20

Timetravel_0-lt might not be as destructive as you think. Depending on how =
close any object is to the=20
field, it might not do any damage at all except for the floor.=20

Pamela:5.what would happen to a bird or small animal that ran across the fi=
eld right when it was producing=20
the field to travel?=20

Timetravel_0-lt would be quickly spread out over the lateral length of the =
gravity field. Imagine being=20
squished and stretched at the same time. I would imagine anything left afte=
r that would be vaporized and=20
generate static electricity.=20

Pamela:6.how hot would you say the temperature gets on the outside of the c=
ar while in operation?=20

Timetravel_0-Very! hot. Depending on the power setting, 100 to 120 degrees =
is average.=20

Pamela:7.is the car in drive mode when the device is activated or is it tot=
ally turned off?=20

Timetravel_0-The car is off and the brake on.=20

Pamela: 8.has the device been tested on ships and airplanes?=20

Timetravel_0-Not that I'm aware of. Its important that it remain as still a=
s possible so the gravity=20
sensors can get a good lock. The divergence confidence would be way off if =
the vehicle was moving.=20

Pamela:9.do you wear special uniforms when you time travel? what do they lo=
ok=20

like and does your group have a timetravel emblem or group name?=20

Timetravel_0-I wear a standard civilian service uniform during instruction =
and training.Its sort of a cross=20
between an army uniform and overalls. We do have aquarter master who distri=
butes clothing appropriate to=20
whereever we are going. There is a patch. It is round and has a graphic of =
aKerr singularity (sort of=20
looks like an eye with gravity waves around it)with two spiral paths runnin=
g through it's center. One path=20
represents the"safe" way and the other is the path to God. The bottom of th=
e patch has myunit number along=20
with "Temporal Recon" printed on it. However, we removeany identification a=
nd patches before we go=20
anywhere=20


Pamela:=20

by the way can you tell me what it feels like to time travel? when you are=
=20
in the process of doing it what does it feel like and what do you see and=
=20
hear, you made mention that you had to get use to the fields. Do you see a=
=20
bright flash of light?=20

Timetravel_0:=20

Interesting first question. The unit has a ramp up time after thedestinatio=
n coordinates are fed into the=20
computers. An audible alarm and asmall light start a short countdown at whi=
ch point you should be secured=20

ina seat. The gravity field generated by the unit overtakes you very quickl=
y.You feel a tug toward the=20

unit similar to rising quickly in an elevator andit continues to rise based=
 on the power setting the unit=20
is working under.At 100% power, the constant pull of gravity can be as high=
 as 2 Gs or moredepending on=20
how close you are to the unit. There are no serious sideeffects but I try t=
o avoid eating before a=20
flight.No bright flash of light is seen. Outside, the vehicle appears toacc=
elerate as the light is bent=20
around it. We have to wear sunglasses orclose our eyes as this happens due =
to a short burst of=20
ultravioletradiation. Personally I think it looks like your driving under a=
 rainbow.After that, it appears=20
to fade to black and remains totally black until theunit is turned off. We =
are advised to keep the windows=20
closed as a greatdeal of heat builds up outside the car. The gravity field =
also traps asmall air pocket=20

Just a few questions, I apologize if they don't seem 100% thought out or if=
 they've already been answered,=20
I'm tired and I have a lot of work still to do.=20

1) You say your machine has roughly a 60 year limit. Is it possible to go b=

years?=20

2) Have the people of your time proved the "worldline theory?" If they have=
, is there any information you=20
can share with is that proves it?=20

3) Ever hear the story of Edipus? To make a long sotry short, after being t=
old he will kill his father and=20
marry his mother he moves far away. On the road he acciddently killed his f=
ather and ended up marrying his=20
mother. Thus, the prophecy is what caused him to fulfill it. You say you do=

I do have a question, something that will definitely tell me whether you ar=

So here goes...=20

There have been many movements in music...rock, disco, and hip hop are some=
 of them. Though most people=20
probably can't rifle out names of musical groups from 35 years ago, they pr=

awareness of what musical influences prevailed at the time. So my question =
is...what is the NEXT big=20
movement in music that will take place here in the US, specifically?=20

I have the feeling this sort of knowledge isn't the stuff you go to Vegas a=

generalized and pretty vague, as well. Of course, being as simple-minded as=
 I am, I would figure that most=20

((Your question referred to army basic training. My earlier comment referre=

Are you sure about that? I remember distinctively you saying that you got a=
pproached for this mission right=20
after basic training. I mean, it was one of my first posts to you in the ot=
her forum. After saying "good=20
thing I got injured, or that would have been my fate too."=20

By the way, not to be picky or anything. But I know how perfect you like to=

I just wanted to point out that you misspelled CHOOSEN. It's Chosen, with o=

((I'm not sure but it sure looks like your trying to say I'm being truthful=

However, if you're trying to hurt my feelings, comparing me to a politician=

Ok, here's were we had a failure in communication. I have been saying all a=
long that you manipulate your=20
statements to benefit your story. I was only saying that you keep doing thi=

3. Sharing scientific theories of Time Travel to your past, which is our pr=

3. Using your perfect English and logic to manipulate others into believing=

4. Asking for volunteers to go back with you to the year 2036.=20

5. Saying where you were born and where you live, and knowing that governme=

6. Admitting that you have a secret agenda. With that said, you know anythi=

miles. A 100 Megaton nuclear weapon will vaporize metal to 35 miles and hav=
e a heat effect to about 250=20
miles. I believe the largest nuclear weapon ever built and tested was about=
 60 megatons. As I recall, the=20
popular strategy toady is to strike targets with multiple numbers of smalle=
r warheads. The 100 Kt to 1 Mt=20
are the most popular. I believe there are about 150 - 200 major cities in t=
he US and half as many military=20
targets. Please correct me someone if I am grossly incorrect.=20

((You suggest bicycle. What about horseback?))=20

Yes, horses are good if you can feed and water them. Also, it's very hard t=
o eat a bicycle.=20

((Should we be stockpiling guns?))=20

The answer to this is NO! You will draw a great deal of negative attention =
to yourself. I recommend become=20
familiar with firearms. This means taking a safety course and learning to s=
hoot and clean many different=20
types. There will be plenty of guns around when you need them.=20

The people with the most to lose if the world changes -Camel through the ey=

((Is the conflict racial in any way?))=20

Not at all. In fact, I would say it goes a long way toward erasing racial p=
roblems.=20

((Does the civil war start in such a way that with this foreknowledge those=
 willing will have time to=20

Yes. You will be forced to ask yourself how many civil rights you will give=
 up to feel safe.=20

((Will you readily be able to identify the enemy.))=20

They will be the ones arresting and holding prople without due process.=20

((Does living near a river with a distillation unit take care of water prob=
lems?))=20

There is an odd saying that might be appropriate here. Safe is anywhere a h=
ungry person can't walk in three=20
days. Water is important but you must consider that when people need it the=
y will know where to get it. I=20
would not plan on planting myself permanently next to a water source. Yes, =
distillation dose make water=20
safe but the runoff is highly dangerous. Please remember that distillation =
is not boiling.=20

((How are the five people within the 100 miles contacted?))=20

Now I'm not volunteering but.=20

I've noticed as so must have most of us. There are a lot of questions being=
 asked that John has responded=20
to.=20

Perhaps one of us could volunteer to compile all the direct q&amp;a sort of=
 a John Titor FAQ. This way new=20
posters can read all the answers that have been given and not have the same=
 questions asked over and over.=20

John, we can have a topic just for the faq right on this board I think?=20

General...=20

I don't think John is starved for web space to post his manual and pictures=
, many have offered John=20
whatever resources he needs including me. So far he has not been interested=
.=20

I'd be more than happy to give him a web site, a domain name, for that matt=
er a web server if it would help=20
get more answers and time out of him. Call me gullible if you want but I wo=
uld do that.=20

John:=20

My mention of Joseph Campbell was a rebuttal to someone who claimed that yo=
ur General story was un=C2=AC=20
original. In fact the most likely leader of a movement like the one you des=
cribe would most likely be a=20
Farmer since being a Farmer would provide much of the scenario required.=20

My asking you if the mention of CERN going on-line and discovering this and=
 that, was a prediction was a=20
genuine question completely un-related to "making a Buck".=20

I wondered if it was just a hint you were giving as to something that could=
 be verified after the fact with=20
little chance of you mentioning it having an effect on it.=20

I'm sure it's hard to remember what each poster has said, but in my case yo=
u missed. I have argued that the=20
important thing here is the discussion and not if "you are" or "you are not=
" a TT. For me what is=20
interesting is the type of questions that are being asked, and the apparent=
 hostility that someone like=20
you can be subjected to for no "good" reason.=20


234=20


Ultimately there is no way to "prove" anything conclusive here.=20

Since I believe time travel is possible "now" I don't have a problem with y=
our story. I like your story=20
since it ends up being a better world than we have now. I hope it is true.=
=20

If it is we are all lucky to have had a chance to talk to a TT. If not then=
 I wish you either a quick=20
recovery or a great career as a Sci Fi writer.=20

What can we gain from this discussion? is the real question.=20

I have already benefited from it as I believe you have, and many others.=20

Javier... To comment on Lola's post. I understand your frustration, you wan=
t your questions answered.=20

If I were John I would not answer your questions either or skirt them. Not =
because they are not valid, as=20
they may be, but because your buttons are being pressed by his non complian=
ce.=20

I'm sure even in 2036 there is a tendency to tease one's detractors if they=
 make themselves available.=20

To expose someone you have to present "proof" the same type of "proof" you =
are asking him for. According to=20
our Laws if this were a court case John would not have to prove where he ca=
me from. The burden of proof is=20
on the prosecution. It's up to you to prove he is not a TT.=20

So far most of your assertions have been related to either John not answeri=
ng your questions, or some=20
inconsistency in his story revolving around his Basic training and it's rel=
evance to when he was recruited=20
for time travel.=20

Also his use of "perfect" English. His English is good but far from perfect=
.=20

John has "not answered" some of my questions to "my satisfaction" and I for=
 one am not ready to sign up for=20
either the "I believe" camp or the "I don't believe" camp.=20

My reason for straddling the fence at this time is that.=20

No one here has presented any evidence either way that would be conclusive.=
 Not you, not John, not anyone.=20

In a game of chess you have to either kill your oponent or chip away at his=
 defenses until you trap him and=20
he gives up. To do that you have to mount an offense that will neutralize h=
is defenses. Conversly you have=20
to mount a defense to repel his onslaught. So far you've not mounted either=
.=20

John is "playing you" Javier. It's an old trick, if your most vociferous de=
tractor continually puts on weak=20
attacks, it takes attention away from the really challenging questions.=20

I'd be willing to bet that if you took all the posts from this BBS and the =
other one, and compared all of=20
it, you may find more ammo for your cause.=20

If I was going to come after a person, I would not warn him, I'd just get a=
ll my facts together, give him=20
no warning and set up a line of questioning designed to trap him into "Mutu=
ally exclusive statements" if=20
you could log enough of these you could prove he's having trouble keeping t=
he story together. A good sign=20
that he is not telling the truth.=20

Example:=20

If you know enough about physics you can get him to say he doesn't undestan=
d a concept that would be=20
required to understand some other concept he claims to understand. To do th=
at you have to know more than=20
him. He knows as much physics as anyone posting here to say the least.=20

Colloquial slips:=20

If you analize all his statements you'll find he is aware of some colloquia=
lisms, and not others. That by=20
itself is not much since he claims to come from the future you would expect=
 some colloquial deviation. The=20
thing to look at is which ones he knows and uses and which ones he doesn't.=
=20

He knows "make a buck" and "more power to you", and "off the cuff".=20

He is unaware or dislikes "buy in" or "buy that"=20

Does that prove anything? not really. Given enough text you can profile him=
 and make a good guess.=20

Still it doesn't "prove" anything. You have the same chance of exposing him=
 as he has of convincing you.=20
None.=20

Here's one for you John.=20

What 82 page book written in England in 1884 is required reading for all ph=
ysics students? I admit it's=20
possible you may not know in 2036, but highly unlikely. The same reason tha=
t makes it so important for=20
physics students would make it just as important to understanding Time trav=
el.=20

Secondly why is this little book so important.=20

If he doesn't know this it lends more circumstantial evidence to your side.=
 But he could ask someone and=20
then how do you prove that?=20

How many amateur Physicists here know that answer without looking it up? Re=
ally. If you don't know this off=20
the top of your head, you don't know squat about Hyperdimensional Physics o=
r it's potential technological=20
application. Unless you are Stephen Hawking, this is what it takes to get s=
tarted. By the way Stephen=20
Hawking read this book and knows exactly what I'm talking about. As do all =
phycisists.=20

How about this? Let John make a recording of himself saying he is from the =
future and whatever other part=20
of his story he wants. We could submit that to voice stress analysis. Is th=
at enough? no again, since a=20
well trained person can beat a voice stress analysis by using self hypnosis=
 or having someone hypnotize=20
them prior to recording. Again no proof.=20

Short of grabbing John and pumping him full of Sodium pentathol you are not=
 going to have any conclusive=20
proof until after he leaves and has made some predictions for you to check.=
 Since he says this is not his=20
timeline you can't be sure a prediction is even a prediction. Again "no Pro=
of".=20

So how is it you propose to expose John? can you show "me" your rationale. =
After all your statements and=20
mine are up for scrutiny the moment we make them just like John.=20

I realize in your mind you already have exposed him, just not good enough t=
o convince me, and I would=20
hazard to guess a number of others here.=20

Let's say everyone here agreed John was a fake. What then?=20

No more dicussion. End of exchange no more platform. Maybe.=20

Anyway, that's my take. I don't think you are hostile just a little excited=

I remember reading a book about 7 years ago.=20

GENERATIONS: THE HISTORY OF AMERICAS FUTURE=20

It was a sociological look at the history of the United States through the =
lens of different generational=20
groups. The Authors noted a four cycle repetition.=20

Its a bit of hard book to summarize, though its central thesis is this - Hi=
story follows certain cycles.=20
With respect to this folder, what stuck out for me was that the Millenial K=
ids (recently born and probably=20
up to about 10 or 12 now) were of the same type as the kids who grew up and=
 built the US infrastructure=20
during the 30's and 40's -and then fought WW2. (GI Generation) The GIs were=
 classified as a very civic=20
minded generation. So will the Millenial Kids(MKs). MKs will go on to build=
 the global infrastructure of=20
the information age, the new transportation systems and the new municipal i=
nfrastructures. Similar to the=20
GIs they will then go on to engage in global conflict.=20

Posted by Lola Montez on 02-22-2001 12:13 AM=20

John,=20

Thank you for getting to some of my questions. Here are a couple more.=20

You say you were in the militia fighting the US Army. I would think that ci=
vilians would have a snowballs=20
chance in hell of successfully fighting the military. What does this look l=
ike? Is it a stalemate with the=20
resistance/militia hiding out until the cities are wiped out allowing them =
to surface?=20

You site the approximate number of cities and military bases intact before =
the nuclear attack. Are they ALL=20
hit? Three days walk from where? The nearest city? Again, though, what popu=
lation makes a city a city and=20
not a town?=20

Does any one or any group stay neutral during all of these years of fightin=
g? Does anyone just lead a=20
reasonably normal life during the civil war? You say the civil war lasts fr=
om 2004 to 2008 and then the=20
short big one in 2015. What do the years from 2008 to 2015 look like? How l=
ong does WWIII last.=20

Where is the safest place in the US to be. Come on be a sport. We all seem =
worth saving, don't we? Besides=20
it would be interesting to see if any of us took you seriously enough to en=
d up there. I don't think I=20
believe in coincidence. Maybe the reason we are all on this board now is to=
 find this out.=20

You mention the nature of Canadians but I don't think you mentioned the imp=
act of all of this on that=20
country. Would you?=20

Also, regarding your view on the afterlife. I also think that it is a myste=
ry to unravel. That it is=20
information, awareness, state of mind and experience that leads to enlighte=
nment and the experience of=20
God. Deeds and Dogma just don't do it. As our awareness broadens doing the =
right thing is what comes=20
naturally (more often, anyway!)If it is based on someone else's idea of rig=
ht it is a shallow and sporatic=20
endeavor. Religion must be experiential or it has no staying power (and pro=
bably not enough compassion or=20
tolerance).=20

Oh yeah, one more thing that is rather haunting is your allusion to the pos=
ition of women as being=20
controversial and conservative in 2036. Yikes! What is that supposed to mea=
n?=20

To Javier - You made mention of something about folks taking someone into t=
heir lives, etc etc. While I=20
understand that point of view - the "trust no one, be paranoid" very well -=
 since I am like that myself, I=20
have to say that you and a few others that have made comments here detract =
from the discussion in one=20
aspect. Let me explain before you misunderstand me.=20

In our society today, we have nothing but untrusting, cynical people out th=
ere. For good reason, most of=20
them have had bad experiences. The internet is not to be trusted in general=
 and people in general=20
shouldn't be trusted.=20

Now, what I am trying to say here (not very well) is this is akin to some o=
f the antigun people I meet.=20

When I talk about the Second Amendment to them, they get all upset and scre=
am and yell how no one should=20
have guns and if there were no guns there would be no crime or war. I calml=
y point out that there were=20
wars before there were guns, and they go on about how that was a "less civi=
lized society"...=20

Then there are the "skeptics" about UFOs, and any kind of odd, out of the o=
rdinary occurrences (for=20
instance. Big Foot, alien abductions, SETI etc). Let's say for instance som=
eone is a "skeptic" - that=20
doesn't mean they should close their minds completely to anything new, in f=
act, doesn't mean they should=20
close their eyes to the apparently impossible.=20

In "my world" everything is possible. Just because we have a set of mathema=
tics to describe something here=20
and now, does NOT mean there isn't a loop hole in those calculations.=20

What I'm getting at is very simple. I don't believe John is a time traveler=
 right now. I have enough of a=20
physics background to understand his information though and (assuming he IS=
 real) eventually he will hit=20
on something that I personally can use to verify for myself the truth.=20

I think Ernie said nothing would be conclusive proof. Then again, I don't r=
equire conclusive proof to keep=20
"alive the idea that time travel is possible".=20

What I'm trying to say is that you've set yourself up to be John's nemises =
for some reason. If it is to=20
protect the rest of us, that isn't necessary. We're all adult, thinking (fr=
ee thinking) individuals who=20
have the right to whatever beliefs we wish in this day and age, regardless =
of our gender, religious=20
believes, race or even in my humble opinion, nationality.=20

In other words... a skeptic is a good thing to be. Each of us should have o=
ur own, interal skeptism to use to=20
mediate our belief systems. But, when someone comes in loud and strong tryi=
ng to force everyone to his or=20
her point of view, there is a serious problem.=20

Now, I'm not asking that you (or anyone) NOT pursue their ideas, and ideali=
sm, nor am I even asking you not=20
to try to convince people. I'm simply pointing out that we all have a right=
 to our beliefs - without=20
ridicule from anyone else.=20

Don't get me wrong here, I am not taking any one's "side" as I don't believ=
e there are sides to take here.=20

Someone else (I forget who it was) mentioned something about nuclear weapon=
s being tossed from corner to=20
corner of the earth and the impossibility of that. Think again.=20

There is more of a nuclear threat, right now, today in 2001 than there was =
in 1983. During the Cold War, we=20
never would have launched a nuke, nor would have the Soviet Union at each o=
ther.=20

However, there is a greater threat today because many smaller, and somewhat=
 unstable countries are getting=20
nuclear capability - and have access to other countries who would sell nuke=
s without any qualms.=20

Yes, biological threats are bigger, but do not rule out nukes, ever.=20

Even the CIA special report that came our recently mentioned what I just sa=
id.=20

I guess the only thing we need in this discussion are some more pictures of=
 manuals, and/or a video tape of=20
John's "depature" (if that is what you would call it??) from our time line.=

However, please understand that my intention is to just keep it real. And b=

People will march to the sound of his beating drum if someone doesn't speak=
 up and offer an other side. In=20
other words, lots of people here are one sided.=20

Some aren't free willed thinking individuals as you described... Some need =

 A short-cut more like it.=20

John Titor:=20

It's comforting to know miracles still occur in the future as well as the d=
istant past. I refer to your=20
report on the Aussies repelling a Chinese invasion.=20

How come it doesn't bother you that people may die through your inaction ye=
t you find it "morally wrong"=20
that you might affect lives by active involvement?=20

Isn't it just as morally wrong to affect lives through inaction as it is th=
rough action? Hint: The answer=20
is YES.=20

One of the issues that runs throughout your posts is this moral ambiguity. =
You've thought it through enough=20
to decide it boils down to personal decision (which should liberate you fro=
m further qualms) yet you still=20
say you dare not decide who "deserves" to (live or) die. In other words you=
've made the intellectual=20
realization but it hasn't yet trickled down into your everyday life/actions=
. IE, Since good/evil are=20
subjective/relative, depending on circumstance and viewpoint, you aren't re=
quired to possess precognition=20
to discern all present or future ramifications of any lives you may save ei=
ther by action/inaction. Your=20
immediate decision, in itself, is its own authority. In the basic life vers=
us non-life equation you should=20
choose to support life. Further confusion, such as (as you said) whether yo=
u're qualified to determine who=20
deserves to live or die, is outside your sphere of influence, therefore you=
're not responsible for such a=20
decision. But, here's the crux, rather than decidecide to simply remain uni=
nvolved, you should simply move=20
in the direction of life-affirming action. If good and evil achieve a balan=
ce in the larger picture, as=20
you suspect, and all life is "God" experiencing physical manifestation, the=
 question of you being required=20
to decide who lives or dies is moot. What should motivate you is that which=
 promotes this life process, a=20
subset of which is experience/information/knowledge viability.=20

The fact that I couldn't restrain myself from telling you this because I se=
e you bumping your head against=20
it constantly means, sadly, it's non-experiential for you and probably obst=
ructs your embracing this idea=20
rather than facilitates it.=20

"If you have not lived it, it is not true."=20

"The only real sin is that which obstructs the acquisition of knowledge."=
=20

"Friend, listen. The God whom I love is inside."=20

Thanks for the ride, you've done a great job here.=20

I saw something last night that I want everyone's opinion on. Its concernin=

advertising the same cellular phone product. The first commercial I didn't =

second was obvious .=20

In the first commercial, a man dressed in cold weather gear appears to be i=

cellular phone saying goodbye to his family as if he was going to die in th=
e storm. We then see he is=20
standing in front of a snow machine at a ski resort area.=20

In the second commercial, another man dressed in cold weather gear is talki=
ng on a cellular phone. We see a=20
young women inviting him to a romantic evening. He seems a bit stunned and =
excited, hangs up the phone and=20
runs off. We then see he has abandoned an unconscious person he was giving =
emergency medical treatment to.=20

What do you think of these commercials?=20

Posted by Craig Cuthbert on 02-22-2001 10:49 AM=20

At the risk of asking too many questions and taking up more than my share o=

or responsibility than the=20
person who grabs someone who is about to step off the curb and get hit by a=
 bus. I would not stop and=20
think 'gee, I don't know, do they deserve to be saved from the fate of a ro=
adkill?' A doctor or priest=20
does not take it upon himself to decide who should be helped. A jet pilot d=

travel is just another form of transportation in one sense. Our possible ne=

that would be out of the 60 year limit but I imagine there is some bad guy =

What is the difference between someone like John saving somebody and someon=

The difference, of course is that John has (theoretically) come from the fu=

technology that is not native to our time. That's where the correlation to =
the Prime Directive derives.=20

The real interesting question is the one you two raised. Why is this an iss=

I don't think there are a lot of differences in that analogy. Though you ha=

Javier- I wasn't really trying to be inspirational, only point out that som=
etimes for any understanding to=20
occur, there needs to be a kid of base-line on where we begin an investigat=
ion. That is, we can postulate=20
all we wish, but a theory must be in place, and several aspects of the expe=
riment must be given a kind of=20
non-variance in regards to belief. That is, if we do not believe ANYTHING w=
e see or hear, we can never=20
honestly learn, since nothing is believeable!=20

That is my take on this. Sure, I don't necessarily believe John is a time t=
raveler, and I do understand=20
that a debate (or argument if you prefer the term) prevents stagnation. Fol=
ks who blindly believe in=20
anything that comes along are the same people that PT Barnam spoke about (i=
e "There's a sucker born every=20
minute"). I am certain no one here is a sucker, but, folks tend to want to =
go with the crowd. I don't. You=20
don't. And John obviously doesn't.=20

I would suggest that if you asked 100 people about time=20

travel 80% or more would say they think it is possible in SOME MANNER. 99% =
of them won't have a clue about=20
science either. So... given that we have a wide range of people and talents=
 here, I give everyone his and=20
her due where it comes to "believing". If they wanna believe, that is THEIR=
 perogitive. We really don't=20
need some hero to come along and "save us".=20

Expose the truth, yes. So keep up the good work, haha=20

John - commercials. They are ignorant commercials. In fact, almost every co=
mmercial on television these=20
days are either totally stupid (so they come out funny), or they are aimed =
at people whose humor suffers=20
from being "in the black" a lot. Black humor seems to be the way things go =
these days. I don't much care=20
for it.=20

Javier - a comment about soliers. You're correct. *1* am a solider first. I=
've been in the military 26=20
years now. I've been everything from an electronics teacher, to a team chie=
f at the White House=20
Communications Agency. I've seen combat (though not what most people think =
of as combat - fire fights in=20
Central America). My "real job" as a reservist is the Non-Commissioned Offi=
cer in Charge (NCOIC) of a=20
communications flight for a tactical airlift wing. I have computer, radio a=
nd cryptographers working for=20
me. Our job., main job is to make communications work.=20

Every one of us have traveled someplace dangerous, and done jobs that most =
people wouldn't DREAM of doing.=20

In our civilian lives, we are all in computers or some other "less than dan=
gerous career". Every person=20
that works for me can climb, run, survive, shoot... and kill. They all know=
 how to do it from the newest Mom=20
in our group to the oldest man (me). My 18 year olds are just as deadly in =
their jobs as the oldest guy=20
(which is me).=20

If I'm sent to do my job, I will. And killing is one part of it. Some peopl=
e forget that a military=20
member's job is killing sometimes. It isn't always their main job, but it i=
s part of what goes with being=20
a soldier, sailor, airman and marine. Many might balk when told they have t=
o do it... but, they WILL do it=20
when the time comes. Anyone know why? Because it is called survival.=20

If there is to be a war in our future, every man, woman and child now alive=
 will become involved if it=20
comes to OUR HOMEFRONT. That is, more than anything, what John has been say=
ing I believe.=20

Whether it will come or not is a different story. It is MY duty to prevent =
a war. Even though I might be=20
told to fight one, even against my own people - I won't kill Americans. Nor=
 will any other military member=20
in the US Armed forces.=20

So - to John... this is a kind of an answer to something you said earlier o=
n. No, military people are not=20
asked to sign anything saying they will kill anyone. It is either an urban =
legend that has been=20
perpetuated in the past few years, or it really happened with one Marine pl=
atoon in 29 palms. I've had two=20
men tell me they participated, and both say it happened, but it was NOT a m=
ilitary-wide thing.=20

I've researched this. NO ONE HAS ANY DOCUMENTATION ON IT! That's the facts.=
 The fiction is what my side=20
(the progun people) are pushing about the UN. But, that is another discussi=
on for another time - and=20
perhaps another place.=20

Suffice it to say, the US Military will never turn on the people, we are sw=
orn to uphold and defend the=20
Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic=
 ... and to obey the laws of the=20
President and the Officers appointed above (us) me. That means the orders h=
ave to be LAWFUL. Think on that=20
folks, as you consider your future actions.=20

Question=20

I don't see the need to bring out any BS o'meter; what are we going to prov=
e? That it is not worth thinking=20
seriously about what our time traveler friend has come to share with us? Wh=
at is it going to change if we=20
KNOW FOR CERTAIN whether John is really from the future? It will definately=
 change SOMETHING (different=20
for all of us), I know that much for sure, but I don't think we need that s=
ort of distraction at this=20
point.=20

Honestly, I believe that even if John answered all your questions correctly=
, Mike, it would change nothing=20
of the essence of John's message. I really think he is trying to tell us so=
mething; more than the fact=20
that he is a time traveler. Now, if we could just pin-point what it is that=
 he is trying to tell us; I=20
literally mean, pin-point, or focus on. The message is clear, but we like t=
o create lots of fog.=20

Time travel is REAL. Anyone who knows physics well or has listened to Art's=
 guest, Mr. David Anderson about=20
a week ago, knows this.=20

The truth is we can run, but we can't hide (from own actions). So why even =
bother, why not face what we are=20
faced with? Even if we managed to get a knavish grip on a 'magical' time ma=
chine, what would it really=20
change for us... unless we knew what to use it for? It is irrelevant for us=
 to have access to a time machine=20
or to know which time John has come to visit us from when there are really =
more important things for us to=20
think about, at least some of the time. I am not saying we have to BELIEVE =
John to be a time traveler,=20
that is irrelevant, but I think we should listen to his ideas about what we=
 might be able to do in order=20
to prevent our own greeds from consuming us whole.=20

John, I appreciate you being here and I think most of us do, even if your p=
resence only means a good=20
debate, which some of us evidentally enjoy. Debates are good!=20

I would like to finish this post with a question (for John): Is spiritual a=
wakening a difficult process; if=20
yes, then why is it so difficult, and are we all capable of it?=20

 to get a job done (including=20
war fighting) but when diplomacy fails it is the NCO's 'kick @$$ and take n=

Mostly, I see where time travel if is becomes a real thing in our 'time lin=

the US Space Command and then eventually would off shoot to a US Time Comma=

Remember that todays NCOs and Sargents are not like they were in times past=
. Today, some of the enlisted=20
personnel in the United States military are as educated (if not more so) th=
an most of the officers.=20

Also, Javier - about me personally, remember, I'm an active duty RESERVIST,=
 so I am a civilian most of the=20
time. Also, remember that military people, are no different from any one el=
se except in certain attitudes=20
they might maintain. In other words, we are just as curious, just as intell=
igent and just as politically=20
savvy as any civilian out there. The difference being we are sometimes limi=
ted on our avenues of voicing=20
our opinions.=20

The military in general is "conservative" about social, economic and even p=
olitical idealisms. You can not=20
honestly be a "liberal minded" person in the military and expect to last lo=

beliefs that are contridictory to military life.=20

That isn't saying we do not have things like gays, and non-religious people=

have out and out anti-"Republican" "forces" in the military. But, they are =
few and far between.=20

Anyway... I know this is less about time travel than it should be, and semi=

included under the headings of 'faith' and 'good works'.=20

 for men's souls. It's all part=20
of the plan. Your next question may be "Why do you believe that?" ))=20

Please don't think me so cynical. I would never insult or degrade someone's=
 religious views. My next=20

questions would be "what about knowledge?" I am a firm believer that faith =
(and good works) is not enough=20
to get to God. There is a mystery we must solve first. ))=20

Imagining cynicism where it is not is a hobby of mine, please excuse me if =
I sound too paranoid for your=20
tastes.=20

What about knowledge?=20

There are plenty of great mysteries, but if your only aim its to 'get to Go=
d', it is not neccesary to solve=20
them.=20

Faith and good works is enough. Its got to be the right kind of faith and g=
ood works of course, but you=20
don't have to be a wise old monk to get into heaven. .=20

But what about knowledge? That is where the fun begins . . .=20

If ones aim is to become like God, or be able to cooperate with him in his =
future endeavors, or self=20
betterment, then spending ones life questing after knowledge is a good reci=
pe. There are plenty of=20
mysteries to be discovered. But the rewards are not at the end so much as t=
hey are in the journey.=20

Learning is what we are here to do.=20

At the same time, there is still a 'light side' and a 'dark side.'=20

((1) You say your machine has roughly a 60 year limit. Is it possible to go=
 back 60 years and then another=20
60 years? ))=20

Yes, that is possible but the divergence grows exponentially as you move fa=
rther away from your worldline=20
of origin. I could make 50-year jumps to go back and see what the world loo=
ked like 2000 years ago but=20
there is a strong chance it would look nothing like what I expect. There ar=
e larger distortion units that=20
are more accurate and have a larger window.=20

((2) Have the people of your time proved the "worldline theory?" If they ha=
ve, is there any information you=20
can share with is that proves it?))=20

The Many Worlds theory seems to wrap up very nicely into current string the=
ory. Unfortunately, we have not=20
solved string theory yet either but (n-10) seems to be the best working mod=
el we have in 2036. As you are=20
probably aware, the "big equation" does not need the final solution in orde=
r to take advantage of the=20
smaller parts that do work in the real world.=20

((3) Ever hear the story of Oedipus? To make a long sotry short, after bein=
g told he will kill his father=20
and marry his mother he moves far away. On the road he accidentally killed =
his father and ended up=20
marrying his mother. Thus, the prophecy is what caused him to fulfill it. Y=
ou say you don't want to effect=20
anything too much by giving out information, but you could drastically chan=
ge this worldline just by=20
talking about the war, or anything for that matter.))=20

I see your point but do you think Oedipus would not have taken those action=
s if he didn't know the=20
prophecy? I don't believe that knowing a possible future makes it happen. Y=
ou are capable of changing your=20
worldline for the better right now. None of the things I have said will be =
a surprise. They were set in=20
motion ten, twenty, even thirty years ago. Are you really surprised to find=
 out that Iraq has nukes now or=20
is that just BS to whip everyone up into accepting the next war?=20

farewell" which we can all observe. Then you can step into your time travel=
ing truck and vanish for the=20
camera. That will give us something to think about.=20

2) You will be gone from our time line, and we can examine the video tape, =
using voice stress and body=20
language analysis to determine if you were being honest to us about your tr=
ip back to the future.=20

3) You do not have to worry about the ramifications of the tape because of =
time line divergence - and=20
because of several things you've lead us to believe you here, will not be a=
ffected in the least - nor will=20
your time line be affected in your time.=20

4) If there is any doubt in your story now (and there is apparently with Ja=
vier's continued chipping away=20
at the story and your own attitude toward him) then you can clear it up wit=
h such a tape.=20

5) Some of us would really like to believe, have hope for, or even be shown=
 that time travel is not only=20
possible, but practical and already (somewhere/sometime) going on. You can =
prove it to me, beyond a shadow=20
of doubt with a video tape.=20

Now... you've offered to do so. I have the resources to place said tape up =
online. When our web site comes=20
back online we will have plenty of space to do so. (Some of you might be fa=
miliar with the site already -=20
anomalies.net). In any case, we will be more than willing to put up all the=
 photos, manual scans, video=20
tapes and anything else you would be willing to show us. I would even be wi=
lling to fly to whatever place=20
you want and film it myself, at my cost, as long as you give me a bit of a =
heads up.=20

(and for those of you wondering, NO I am NOT doing this for the government.=
 I'm as curious as anyone else=20
here, nothing more, nothing less. I'm not in this for money, I'm not in thi=
s for personal gain - except=20
the knowledge that the "truth is out there")=20

I urge you to do so, if not for=20
yourself or us... for the future.=20

LOLA:=20

((You say you were in the militia fighting the US Army. I would think that =
civilians would have a snowballs=20
chance in hell of successfully fighting the military.))=20

You must realize that why people are fighting is more important that what t=
hey are fighting with. The=20
conflict was not about taking and holding ground it was about order and rig=
hts. They were betting that=20
people wanted security instead of freedom and they were wrong.=20

((What does this look like? Is it a stalemate with the resistance/militia h=
iding out until the cities are=20
wiped out allowing them to surface?))=20

The cities were not isolated because of them; they were isolated because of=
 us.=20

((You site the approximate number of cities and military bases intact befor=
e the nuclear attack. Are they=20
ALL hit?))=20

Nuclear weapons and guidance systems are less than perfect. Most targets re=

some of them were more accurate than others. I would estimate the overall a=
ccuracy was around 60 to 70=20
percent.=20

((Three days walk from where? The nearest city? Again, though, what populat=

No.=20

((You say the civil war lasts from 2004 to 2008 and then the short big one =
in 2015. What do the years from=20

I'm not sure I said that exactly. By 2008, I would say the civil conflict i=
s pretty much at everyone's=20
doorstep. Western instability during the conflict leads to the attack in 20=
15. WWIII is very short with a=20

 much in the same type of=20

((Oh yeah, one more thing that is rather haunting is your allusion to the p=
osition of women as being=20
controversial and conservative in 2036. Yikes! What is that supposed to mea=
n?))=20

It certainly isn't disrespectful. I apologize if it sounded that way. It's =
one of those areas I realize=20
will be difficult to discuss because we may lack similar experiences. In 20=
36, there is not a desire to=20
"have it all". With factors such as the difficulty in conceiving and the de=
centralization of production=20
and industry, there is not an unrealistic scramble to have a "career" and a=

circumstance, family life has become more traditional. However, there are m=
any families where the wife /=20

Many movies that take place in the future show an Earth under ruin, war and=

into that fear people have in some corner of their minds from the very star=

a John Titor worship board. No longer a place to discuss views of Time Trav=

deeply involved in their belief system.=20

My only problem with that is that it's on a wide scale. Tell me something, =
is that why the civil war=20

started? To many people take people like you and put them on pedestals? Lot=
s of people can no longer think=20
on their own, they depend solely now on what you have to say. How pathetic,=
 and your future culture finds=20
no flaw with prolonging it. Instead, they gave one of their Time Traveler (=
meaning you) a device to come=20
to the past and exploit the chance to take and do as you and they see fit.=
=20

That's very nice. You've managed to convince a lot of good people, honest s=
incere people. That your=20
genuine, the real McCoy. That however, may be okay with you, but not by me,=
 not by a long shot.=20

Someone once brought up the example of some of these people being sheep. At=
 first that might have been an=20
unfair presumption, but now that I think about it, it's true. And you still=
 haven't commented on my=20

request to answer my statements. What's wrong? Why don't you?=20

Let's face it John, I'm one of the very last ones you have not corrupted wi=
th your story. It has been your=20
straightforward effort to say you are from the future, and convince others =
of it as well. But just look at=20

you, look at how unprepared you were. The lies you were caught in. And tryi=

I swear, I will expose you John. My passion and conviction in this matter i=
s unquestionable. Your friend=20
Pamela can attest to that.=20

People like you, who use this to benefit from unknowing people, make me sic=
k. Time Travel is an evil means=20
to get what you want; I wouldn't be surprised if your world is Satanic.=20

The fight is not over between you and me John. Nor will it be over any time=

in exposing you as a fraud, there is no doubt about that. I don't fear you =
John, I do however fear a world=20
that has followers like your fans. That only entices me more to continue th=
e fight.=20

If others find that silly and funny, I feel sorry for you. You've lost your=
 sense of passion for doing=20

what's right. You openly accept the flaws of this world, and succumb deeper=
 to them. Creating what we have=20

That saddens me. Call me old=20
fashion, but that kind of mentally is only asking for trouble. That's the s=

I've also been wondering about how you have manage to overcome the simultan=

common worldline references between yourself and the two micro-singularitie=

know, bodies under acceleration lose their initial constant velocity worldl=

each other - the Twins Paradox. Given that you have a possible 2.5% diverge=
nce from your own worldline (5%=20

on a roundtrip?)on a 60 year trip and the micro-singularities (each having =
their own worldline) are=20
subject to the same divergence, how do you keep them in phase? Does the div=
ergence extend into N-=20
dimensions? Is the 2.5% the total error or is each dimension subject to the=
 2.5% divergence individually?=20

I understand that you're a tech (a bus driver as it were) and not the physi=
cist, but how did you manage to=20
overcome the problem of gathering sufficient power to artificially create a=

Actually, Pamela is quite quick to catch many possible discrepancies in wha=

PAMELA ASKS: &gt;1. What type of money system do you have on your world lin=
e? meaning how do you buy and sell=20
things? Do you have the same type of money or do we have a cashless society=

cards or ID biochips.=20

I RESPOND: Its not very different than it is now. Yes, we have money and cr=
edit cards. However, like=20
everything else, the monetary system is decentralized. Banking is based mos=
tly around the community=20
structure. There are no multinational banking or computerized economic syst=

QUESTION ON THIS SITE: ((Is there an IRS and a need to keep a lot of receip=

Posted by Emmett "Darby" Darbyshire on 02-28-2001 11:45 AM=20

John,=20

Thanks for the answer to the original questions. Here are some follow-ups f=
or you to ponder.=20

&lt;&lt;Q: What is the result of the duplicates arriving simultaneously at =
the same place?=20

A: Psychological confusion and a few fist fights. &gt;&gt;=20

John, I think that you missed the point here. The problem that needs to be =
addressed is what happens to the=20
duplicates as they simultaneously arrive at virtually the exact same locati=
on. Given that their masses=20
will occupy the same space, what prevents a naked singularity from forming?=
 (Black holes seem to be the=20
only constructs that can violate the Exclusion Principle. And unless the du=
plicates were drunk they=20
shouldn't be spinning &lt;wink&gt; - thus a naked singularity.)=20

&lt;&lt;Q: How long will it take for the loop to decay? Will it decay? Is i=
t a loop?=20

A: The chances of hitting the precise worldline where all the other duplica=
tes are arriving is almost zero.=20
It's possible but increasingly less probable with each arriving duplicate. =
The divergence decays and the=20
worldline is "less available" for new "yous" to arrive on.=C2=BB=20

It's a nice creative answer, but it didn't address the question. The questi=
on was is it a loop; will it=20
decay and how long will it take to decay? Divergence won't decay, unless yo=
u're saying that the divergence=20
decreases (which I don't believe is what you were indicating). Its true tha=
t each duplicate has a=20
decreasing probability of arriving on the same worldline - but its an infin=
ite number of duplicates. Any=20
subset of that infinity is simply a less intense infinity, but an infinity =
none-the-less. The implication=20
is that an infinite number of duplicates will appear simultaneously. What p=
revents this from happening?=20

&lt;&lt;Q: What happens if the experimenter, upon seeing his duplicate, dec=
ides not to continue the experiment?=20

A: He can always leave the room on his own worldline or put a desk full of =
books in the position where the=20
time machine is arriving every 30 seconds. That will probably trip the VGL =
system and stop the time=20
machines from arriving. &gt;&gt;=20

Again, nice try on the answer. But these duplicates aren't arriving every 3=
0 seconds. They are all arriving=20
simultaneously 30 seconds before the experiment begins apparently violating=
 Causality if the experimenter=20
decides to cancel the trip.=20

This question was a follow-up to your 2.5% worldline error problem. On your=
 60-year journey you have a=20
problem if the error is 2.5% in N-dimensions. If your error is in the 't' d=
imension you have a chance to=20
arrive back home as early as 2034 and as late as 2038. If the error is cumu=
lative for each leg you could=20
arrive as early as 2032 and as late as 2040. Arrive too early and the boss =
won't have a clue as to why you=20
brought him a 1975 vintage computer. Arrive too late and your haven't helpe=
d solve the problem in a timely=20
(excuse the pun) manner.=20

You're also faced again with the Twins Paradox. In this case the twin is yo=
u: The "you" in 2036 and 2001.=20
Each of you is a body in motion and under acceleration (the velocity of Ear=
th, the Solar System, Milky Way=20
Galaxy and Vegan Local Group and the general expansion of the universe are =
not constant.) Moreover, the=20
distance between each "you" is increasing at 54 km/sec. The 2036 Earth is a=
pproximately 60 billion=20
kilometers from where it is today. The 2.5% divergence error is not constan=
t. The longer you stay here in=20
2001 the greater the distance between the two Earths thus the degree of err=
or increases. The physicists in=20
2036 aren't able to help you as they don't know where you are and as you ar=
en't a physicist you're=20
probably not going to be able to make the corrections from this end. How ar=
e you going to get home safely?=20

John, you're actually doing a credible job of handling this thread. I perso=
nally don't believe that you're=20
a time traveler but that's not the point. I have to put some thought into a=
sking these questions. SO, you=20
make me think and that's always good. Thank you.=20

Posted by John Titor on 02-28-2001 12:28 PM=20

EMMETT:=20

I do enjoy the questions and I appreciate the interest.=20

I suppose there is a difference between a thought experiment and the real w=
orld. It appears we have our=20
virtual laboratories confused and I'm not sure I understood all the rules t=
o your experiment and then it=20
occurred to me that in your position, this is all just a thought experiment=
 anyway. I will try to be more=20
literal in my explanation.=20


255=20


((In this experiment the traveler only goes 30 seconds into the past to app=
ear in his lab. It seems that 30=20
seconds before his experiment was to begin he saw himself appear in the lab=
. There would now be two=20
travelers and two time machines. It doesn't appear that it ends that simply=
 as the "second" time traveler=20
says that he saw a duplicate self appear in the lab thirty seconds before h=
e started the trip. It would=20
appear that its a time loop and an infinite number of duplicates see a dupl=
icate self appear in the lab=20
thirty seconds prior to the start of the trip. ))=20

I'm not positive but I don't see anything that indicates the time traveler =
would remain in the same spot=20
once he arrives. 30 seconds is almost long enough to get coffee in your tho=
ught experiment. If that were=20
true, and they all kept moving, than the experiment could go on for quite a=
 while until the planet filled=20
with time travelers. You also stated, "it would appear" as a time loop. If =
it only appears that way, than=20
the natural divergence may stop the experiment when three or four time trav=
elers arrive and the others end=20

((The problem that needs to be addressed is what happens to the duplicates =
as they simultaneously arrive at=20
virtually the exact same location.))=20

Again, you use the world virtually, which to me means not exactly the same =
spot. Under the laws of physics,=20

I don't personally know what happens if it were on exactly the same spot bu=
t I do know it's possible.=20

Under the operational limits of the distortion unit, as soon as the VGL sen=
sors pick up an unexpected mass=20
in the target worldline, it would shut down and drop off in a worldline whe=
re your experiment is not=20
occurring.=20

((Given that their masses will occupy the same space, what prevents a naked=
 singularity from forming?))=20

I see, now they are in the same space. I suppose that's a possibility. If s=
o, than the as soon as the=20
experiment started, a singularity would form under the infinite mass and sw=
allow the planet. Perhaps they=20
tried this on Cygnus?=20

((It's a nice creative answer, but it didn't address the question. The ques=
tion was is it a loop; will it=20
decay and how long will it take to decay?))=20

Well, I think it's a nice creative question too. Under your example, the "l=
oop" would terminate as soon as=20
the singularity forms and would be constantly fed by all the arriving time =
travelers.=20

Thanks again. I'll follow up on the rest in a bit.=20

Why are you so defensive about this whole thread? I may be mistaken, or per=
haps you have a different=20

definition of preach, I don't remember John _ever_ preaching. Nor any of us=
 "worshipping" him. The way I=20
see it, John has made a claim which may be true or may not be. The possibil=
ity of it being true interests=20
some of us, so we have questions. John's doing his best to answer us. Maybe=
 he's full of it, but I enjoy=20
science fiction as much as the next UFO nut.=20

Just because we ask questions, does not mean we are shouting from the rooft=

he is the Messiah". It simply means we are willing to accept the possibilit=
y that he is telling the truth.=20
If he is, great, we can learn from him and look back on these posts when we=

My question for you is this: If John is a fraud, what do you personally sta=

Let me explain. I'm not a "believer" in the sense you're implying. That is,=

 I would have no qualms about=20

In fact, I have no qualms about listening to it now. Regardless of whether =

About Today's World:=20

In the place I work, we look at many different things, including intelligen=

other places and in general the "state of the world". I study many things, =
related and unrelated to my=20
job, but most importantly we in the DoD and military tend to examine everyt=
hing, even the smallest,=20
insignificant incidents in the world, looking for those things that might i=
gnite an all-out war.=20


259=20



If any one has been following global intelligence at all (and you can do as=
 good a job as the CIA on your=20
own, if you simply know where to look) you will see that in the United Stat=
es an "awakening" of sorts has=20
occured regarding our personal freedoms. There are these anti-gun nuts out =
there trying to ban guns -=20
using the children as the catalyst. Without examining the reason we have fo=

last week thing, this is a HISTORICAL THING) then they do us all a disservi=
ce. America is on to them. We=20
are on to those who would take our freedoms and we aren't going to let it h=
appen without a fight. Hence=20
the possibility of "civil war" DOES exist today. If you're not close to the=
 subject you might not see it.=20
Those of us who are protecting our freedoms DO SEE IT.=20

Russia has been "feeling it's oats" lately... doing attack runs on our ship=
s, rattling their sabers (i.e.=20
"We'll pull our support of the internation space station if you even THINK =
of continuing with National=20
Missile Defense - just one example). Russia has not disassembled several nu=
kes they said they did.=20
Satellites show it. They just move them now. China has linked up with Iraq =
- assisting them in repairing=20
their weapons systems - hence the attacks recently on Baghdad.=20

There are reports of Cubans, Chinese and perhaps North Koreans in and aroun=
d the Sonora desert (think about=20
this to understand what it means - basically, that is our weakest border. I=
f *1* were going to put a force=20
against america, I'd come in that way).=20

These are just SOME of the little things. We have a kind of unrest in Ameri=
ca now. It could very well lead=20
to a civil war of sorts.=20

Russia, China, N. Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, France - and you can add quite a=
 few others to this list - would=20
just love to see America on her knees and will do whatever it is they can t=
o help us down there. NEVER=20
EVER UNDERESTIMATE enemies - especially FORMER enemies (like Russia).=20

What I am trying to say, without being able to do so in a short note, is th=
at even if John is "fake" his=20
scenarios are absolutely POSSIBLE and even PROBABLE at this point in our ti=
me line. Those of us who spend=20
time checking intelligence reports can CONFIRM his social theories about "w=
hat might be".=20

In short, even if John is fake - his possibile future is accurate for us, e=
ven now. I hope he (and I) are=20
wrong, and I hope it won't come to a civil war in this country, but I have =
been seeing it coming for a few=20

to BELIEVE in time travel wholeheartedly yet you are the one who spends all=
 of his board time trying to=20
convince us sheep that John is a fraud. You may be the only one who isn't s=
keptical. You are truly the=20
only fanatic, so far, on this board. John has hooked you good. The rest of =
us keep an open mind (something=20
you should consider), learn what we can and have a good time in the process=
. You seem on the point of a=20
nervous breakdown. I have also considered the possibility that you just wan=
t as much attention as possible=20
and are jealous of the position John holds on the board. This stance gets y=
ou more feedback than you would=20
otherwise get. This may be a subliminal motive. Isn't there something else =
you want to do here just in=20
case time travel is as real as you think it is?=20

I'll take a fraudulant time traveller over an evangelist anyday.=20

Your last post smells like revenge to me. This must be for what I said to y=

I don't care about the attention, like I said before I can care less what o=

BOB (from 18):=20

I must preface the following with a bit of melodrama. I feel a bit unqualif=
ied to answer the next few=20
questions for the following reason. The way you and I look at life and deat=
h and its relative value is=20
radically different. As any other soldier can tell you, once you watch a ma=
n's arm come off from a bullet=20
you just fired or have been close enough to feel someone's last breath on y=
our face, it changes you. I can=20
only describe it in two distinct waves. The first feeling is power. You won=
 when it counted and survived.=20
All the personal shortcomings and faults you've carried with you your whole=
 life just melt away in a=20
savage euphoria. If there's time to think about it, the next wave comes sho=
rtly after and is underlined by=20
overwelming guilt. You just killed someone and now God might be ticked off.=
 Fortunately, the second=20
feeling goes away quickly when the shooting starts again and gets shorter a=
nd shorter after every battle.=20
After all, why would God put you in this situation? The point is, I persona=
lly do not like going through=20
that cycle and the decisions I make about life and death might not be the o=
nes you would expect me to=20
make.=20

((How come it doesn't bother you that people may die through your inaction =
yet you find it "morally wrong"=20
that you might affect lives by active involvement?))=20

I'm not sure I said it didn't bother me, I only stated I won't interfere on=
 purpose. Again I refer to a=20
historical example. Before Pearl Harbor was attacked in 1941, a small group=
 of US soldiers were=20
experimenting with a new technology called RADAR. As the Japanese planes we=
re flying toward the island,=20
they actually picked them up in time to thwart the surprise attack. Unfortu=
nately, they were unfamiliar=20
with the equipment and figured it wasn't working correctly. As you are awar=
e, the ruthlessness of the=20
Japanese "sneak" attack galvanized the US people into entering WWII.=20

As a time traveler it would be easy for me to take a short hike up that hil=
l where the RADAR operators were=20
and point out to them that indeed the equipment was working just fine and t=
hey should probably call it in.=20
Assuming they believed me, it is arguable that my lone single action could =
start a chain of events that=20
would allow the US to meet the Japanese planes and stop them from attacking=
 the battleships. As a result,=20
the US people would still be angry but not motivated to enter the war fully=
 since the Japanese were not a=20
precieved threat. Thus, you don't begin research on the atomic bomb until w=
ell after Hitler has already=20
dropped a couple on London.=20

I could save thousands of men on the Arizona at the cost of millions in Lon=
don. I just don't know how one=20
life will affect another. However, if I were standing next to a soldier who=
 was about to be shot by a=20
passing Japanese plane, I would push him to safety. I realize this is incon=
sistent on a small scale but I=20
am tired of watching people die in front of me. If there is a price to pay =
for that than so be it.=20

((Isn't it just as morally wrong to affect lives through inaction as it is =
through action? Hint: The answer=20
is YES.))=20

Why are you concerned about what I might do to corrupt your worldline when =
you have no problem letting=20
other people do it around you every day? Do you blame yourself for not taki=
ng any action right now to=20
"save" people living on your streets or suffering from poverty and disease?=
 Besides, how exactly would you=20
propose I decide who to tell and who not to tell? (provided I knew anything=
 at all).=20

((Your immediate decision, in itself, is its own authority.))=20

What God judges about my decision is the only authority. Again, all the thi=
ngs you claim I can do you are=20
capable of also.=20

((If good and evil achieve a balance in the larger picture, as you suspect,=
 and all life is "God"=20
experiencing physical manifestation, the question of you being required to =
decide who lives or dies is=20
moot. ) )=20

It's not moot to me. To tell you the truth, I'm afraid. I don't want the re=
sponsibility of being expected=20
to know who lives and who dies. I know it would change me for the worse. Be=
sides, how can you be sure my=20
"inaction" now isn't a result of something I've already screwed up and I'm =
trying to fix it? Javier might=20
be right after all. Thanks for the good questions.=20

I've been following this thread from the start, but only posted once or twi=

Let me see if I can get this straight - It's not so much that you don't bel=
ieve John is a Time Traveller,=20
you just wish to uncover his secret agenda? I don't mean to sound sarcastic=

Stephen, or do you prefer Steve?=20

Yes, I do strongly believe in time travel. And it's not so much that I beli=
eve John is a time traveler as=20
well, but yes I like uncovering people's lies when they make grand accusati=

to say John is very clever. But personally I don't like Time Travelers, so =
I can't be like you or the rest=20
and listen to him.=20

Basically like I said, I'm a paradox. My way of thinking may at times be in=
consistent, but that's how I=20
have always been. It's my curse. To believe in something, and experience it=
 first hand, and to then shake=20
it off and say it's not real.=20

Sorta like a double personality, but not really. But I'm not crazy , I can =

I guess I'm just following in the footsteps of my great great great great g=

Javier,=20

I am curious as to what drives you to so passionately need to "save" people=
 from what they want. To over=20
simplify things for the sake of brevity, some are following this thread in =
the pursuit of entertainment=20
and their own curiosity, and others are willing to buy whatever snake oil i=
s closest at hand to make their=20
lives more interesting. Exploring possibilities and boundaries is both heal=
thy and fun. On the occasion=20
that it becomes unhealthy and obsessive, well that's just natural selection=
. At least in this situation=20
those more prone to get carried away are free to choose their own poison in=
 whatever dose they see fit.=20

You yourself being a perfect example. Besides, if everything john says is a=
bsolutely true, what harm has=20
been done? Any changes in this particular world line are specific and inevi=
table and alterations are only=20
alterations to those with the perspective of light cones dipped a couple of=
 degrees off the beaten path.=20
For those naturally in our specific world line the only change made is the =
change that was going to be=20
made anyway. For john any change does not affect his own world line for the=
 same reasons. The only change=20
is in the degree of difference between these two lines, which is only evide=
nt from an outside perspective,=20
but that variance is absolute. In short, it is possible to go back in time =
and kill you parents, but only=20
by traveling to the world line where that is what happens. You can then dec=
ide out of remorse to go back=20
and kill yourself to save your parents, but only by going to the world line=
 where you do that. However=20
this does not change the world line where you successfully commit parricide=
, because in that line they did=20
die. Future and past within a specific world line is absolute. Time travel =
merely grants the traveler the=20
unique ability to recognize variances between world lines. Therefore, any c=
hanges to our world line are=20
actually not really changes, because our tomorrow will be what it is going =
to be and will not change when=20
looking at it from the perspective of the day after tomorrow. So no matter =
how insidious or innocuous=20
johns "secret agenda" is, he cannot affect any changes that he is not going=
 to affect anyway. It's a=20
battle that can't be won because in our future it already has or has not be=
en. I know this all sounds a=20
little convoluted, but the mathematics behind it all are actually rather si=
mple. Which brings me to a=20
question for John.=20

John,=20

I don't mean to suggest that I accept any of what you claim, but I do have =
a technical question. Are the=20
singularities in your machine supposed to be offsetting the light cones of =
particles within it's sphere of=20
influence allowing the world lines of these particles to appear to loop for=
m the perspective of particles=20
outside the effected area? I don't mean to insult you by spelling out the o=
bvious to you so basically, but=20
that seems the most obvious need of a singularity. If so, how can you accou=
nt for generating a gravity=20
well deep enough to create such a disparity between light cones without suc=
king the planet through the eye=20
of a needle? Also, this requires motion through the space immediately influ=
enced by the mass, yet you=20
claim travel is accomplished while the traveler is stationary. I look forwa=
rd to your response....=20

Posted by Stephen McKay on 03-01-2001 10:02 PM=20

Javier,=20

Probably prefer Steve, but it doesn't really bother me. As far as I can see=
 John is not making accusations=20
but claims. I also think it is important to uncover deception, but I'm not =
sure what makes you so sure=20
that John is lying.=20

He may slip up, but he's only human, as are we all. I just don't think the =
point lies in whether or not=20
John is from the future. He's made his claim and unfortunately there is no =
proof either way. As much as=20
you may believe it, I don't think you can use his posts to disprove his cla=
ims, nor can they be used to=20
prove them.=20

The point is that what he says is fascinating. Millions of people go to see=
 psychics and fortune tellers,=20
not because they believe they are seers and everything they say is true, bu=
t because they are curious. I=20
think that is the same attitude of most people asking questions of John. If=
 John did tell us of a company=20
whose worth jumps drastically in the next few years, I honestly doubt that =
anyone on this thread would=20
invest their savings in that company.=20

They're not devoting their lives to John's words, they're just interested. =
As I said earlier, if John's=20
telling the truth, then we all get a sneak peek and preparation for the fut=

an entertaining story. If we read this thread in that light, then we have n=

Regarding your 2-21-01 comments on my first post,i.e.,=20

that I should view the video "Waco,The Rules Of Engagement" to get a better=
 understanding and=20
appreciation(I suppose)for federal law enforcement personnel acting crimina=
lly beyond the pale. And ,you=20
asked rhetorically,( I may be paraphrasing somewhat) "if the allegations ma=
de in this piece were proven to=20
be true, what would you hope would happen, nothing?"=20

My answer to that is that if these allegations were proven to be true I wou=

every confidence that our criminal justice system would prosecute and convi=
ct whoever the criminal=20
perpetrators turned out to be, whether federal cops, or otherwise(thereby o=
bviating the need for citizen=20
uprisings).=20

The ATF,followed by the FBI, clearly blundered at Waco, causing the needles=

citizenry. However, to charge these federal officers with criminal violatio=
ns of the law either directly=20
or=20

impliedly as is done in this video, simply doesn't accord with the real fac=

to suggest that not only the FBI, but other federal as well as state and lo=

have learned something from the Waco tragedy, and will take great care not =

This, of course, goes directly against your predicted scenario for the next=

all these things happen after our Constitution is suspended, and our republ=

I'll be gone soon. I really do not have time for this. First of all, to Ric=
k, everyone wants to protect=20
their family. The reason I can not buy into this is: if John is making up a=
 story, it is a very wrong=20
thing to do. The interests of the day are the same ones from back in the '5=
0s. People were building bomb=20
shelters, and by the 1960's, I was there, everyone thought that no one woul=
d survive a nuclear war. It is=20
self-evident. The US alone has more nuclear weapons that would blow up this=
 Planet a 100 times over. I had=20
32 nuclear missiles aimed at me every second of every minute of every hour =
of every day for the thirty=20
years this Cold War was going on. By the 1970's smiling Pres. Jimmy Carter =
said, "Its MAD", Mutual Assured=20
Destruction. If we are to have a War, we will not stop until everything is =
utterly completely destroyed=20
for we can not win a Nuclear War. Carl Sagan came out in the 1980's and sai=
d if too many nuclear missiles=20
are released in even a limited nuclear war that it would cause a nuclear wi=
nter. If anyone survived, there=20
would be no food, and like in the past when the dinasours disappeared, huma=
ns would just die off. No one=20
wins in a Nuclear War. In the 1980's Pres. Reagan said exactly that, "If yo=
u launch, we launch, if we=20
launch, you launch". "NO ONE WINS". Everyone dies. We will start Star Wars,=
 to protect ourselves. Of=20
course Star Wars the movie was out in 1980 and told us about something new,=
 a new way of looking at=20
things, yes, the Force. Use the Force. What do you think people have been d=
oing? It commonly referred to=20
as a Relaxation Response Method. You block out negative thoughts coming int=
o your head, by conscious=20
effort, and say something like "Cancel, cancel." This takes practice and ef=
fort to reprogram your brain.=20
What we have now in the US is people who do not know these techniques. We h=
ave been doing this since about=20
1985. Star Wars Reagan began a process that nuclear weapons would be reduce=
d. Now in the 1990's, Saddem=20
was not going to get by with his "Naked Agression" and thats exactly what P=
res. Bush meant. Now Pres.=20
Clinton signed an Accidental Nuclear Release Treaty with Pres. Boris Yelste=
in. If terrorists get ahold of=20
a nuclear device, we will call first, to avoid an all out exchange of nucle=
ar missiles. Some in the US, as=20
some in Russia, think a Nuclear War is winable, IT IS NOT. This has been pr=
oven time and time again. Yet=20
minor countries like North Korea or major countries like China or India or =
Pakistan want to continue on=20
with developing longer ranged nuclear missiles. They already have them. The=
 point is the SDI defense,=20
making nuclear missiles obsolete. How? That's easy. It's still the same wit=
h the US. We have more nuclear=20
weapons than Russia. If anyone launches a all out War, the US will literall=
y destroy this entire Planet.=20
AND WE MEAN IT. We have lived it, so when someone comes and says I am from =
the future, and there is a=20
Nuclear War and a Civil War, I say "Bull". Every country in this world know=
s that the US will destroy this=20
entire Planet if it needs too. There will not be a limited Nuclear War in m=
y estimation. Having all lived=20
through this 50 years of crap, makes us not be interested by annoying peopl=
e claiming this or that after=20
having a Cold War with Russian leaders. We are not amused at this type of b=
ehavior. This will not cause a=20

No, that's not how it works. The singularities are used to manipulate gravi=
ty around the observer. The=20
singularities do not interact with any matter except the electrons that are=
 injected onto its event=20
horizon. The hazardous areas of gravity are quite small and exist only arou=

and another area created in the gravity sinusoid outside the vehicle.=20

((I don't mean to insult you by spelling out the obvious to you so basicall=

No insult taken. I would imagine we both agree that standing behind an oper=

thing to do also.=20

((If so, how can you account for generating a gravity well deep enough to c=
reate such a disparity between=20
light cones without sucking the planet through the eye of a needle?))=20

The gravity well created by the singularities is not that large. The portio=
n of the field that is felt by=20
the operator is about the equivalent of 2 Gs. I would urge you to examine a=
 Penrose diagram for a Kerr=20
black hole. As you are probably aware, the singularity is donut shaped and =
exhibits two event horizons.=20

The singularities are used to "simulate" a path through the center of one o=
f these singularities which is=20
what takes the observer to an alternate worldline. Earlier in the thread I =
did go into this in a bit more=20
detail.=20

((Also, this requires motion through the space immediately influenced by th=
e mass, yet you claim travel is=20
accomplished while the traveler is stationary.))=20

The unit must be stationary during operation due to the sensitivity of the =
gravity sensors. Any motion with=20

ularities off.=20

John: Thanks for your response. I understand the dilemma and paradoxes invo=
lved in the moral questions. I'm=20
still not convinced, though, that of the two basic choices of involvement/n=
oninvolvement when faced with=20
an immediate moral dilemma, you find inaction okay but action (active inter=
vention) suspect. I don't see=20
why you don't regard them equally.=20

Example: I'm at a blind intersection and I see a bus barreling down on a ma=
n who's crossing the street.=20
Would God condone me staying out of it because I feared the moral ramificat=
ions of the myriad future=20
scenarios? This kind of second-guessing would prevent any immediate action.=
 Lifeguards, firemen and cops=20
would be rendered obsolete. With such a standard I could leave a kitten up =
a tree, a wandering child=20
outside on a cold night, a blind woman headfirst in a snowbank, on and on, =
because I really don't know=20
what affect these living beings will have on future events.=20

How can a God expect you to be omniscient, that's His job. Since you're not=
 omniscient you're not=20
responsible, which is what I meant by "moot."=20

There are an infinite amount of variables. Therefore the Pearl Harbor scena=
rio is ambiguous. You don't know=20
that involvement of a timetraveller would prevent a nation's motivation. Or=
 that it wouldn't. Or that your=20
inaction is any more moral than involvement.=20

What concerns me is that your reasoning endorses any sort of noninvolvement=
 in day-to-day events - yes,=20

have simply stayed out of it=20

Javier: [Well Rick, you seem to have a passionate belief in something as we=
ll. Yet you blame me for having=20
the same zest. You accuse me of being harsh; yeah maybe I was just a tad. B=
ut you call these people who=20
want to take away the second amendment "nuts," how do you think they will f=
eel about you saying that? So I=20
see it as something one in the same. ]=20


265=20


Javier, I do have a passionate belief in something - the Constitution. But,=
 you misunderstand a bit. I'm=20
not BLAMING anyone for anything. Let me see if I can say this simply... we =
all want to learn something. By=20
you (or anyone) denying outright the existence of something - or attacking =
it directly as a "bad thing"=20
without listening to both sides, you deny the chance for observation, and t=
herefore, learning. Nothing=20
against your methods, but, to put the problem into the perspective that "th=
is is simply wrong" without=20
back up justification for it being wrong - other than your own perception (=
which some of us might not=20
understand) makes it hard for anyone to follow the story. I just have a pro=
blem with anyone lumping=20
EVERYONE that doesn't have the same beliefs as that person (doing the 'lump=
ing'), in the same category.=20

As for your example of my calling the anti-gun people "nuts" - it isn't the=
 same thing. We do not know the=20
"history of time travel" but we DO know the history of Europe and America a=
nd that many, many times=20
history has shown that tyrants take arms from the people to keep themselves=
 in power. This has been=20
repeated over and over throughout history. Our history, our time line. So, =
I could care less if they are=20
"upset" by me calling them nuts. They are, plain and simple, ignorant peopl=
e who do not know or understand=20
their own history - and who use emotionalism to take something away. They a=
re wrong and by my defination=20
they are nuts. You are calling everyone sheep who are going along with the =
story line here, because they=20
are curious, wish to learn, understand or perhaps even believe that there i=
s some truth to the story.=20

There is nothing wrong with someone following along or playing along with t=
he story, it certainly does not=20
make them sheep.=20

The difference is, we do not know for certain Time Travelers can affect the=
 world time line of ourselves.=20

If they can and do, we WOULDN'T KNOW IT! If, as in John's example, he goes =
up the hill and helps the Radar=20
folks (and I'm very familiar with not only this particular story, I'm famil=
iar with various historical=20
changes that MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED because I've written a paper on that VERY =
subject many years ago in=20
college) - then there might have been changes that would have prevented us =
from entering the war,=20
developing the bomb before Hitler and perhaps we would all be speaking Germ=
an today. So if that happened=20
because of a time traveler... would we know it? How do we know that someone=
 DIDN'T interfere already=20
ALLOWING US TO WIN THE WAR? We do not know this.=20

Michael E. Hendrickson: Just a couple quick comments, because I am not sure=
 I understand where you're=20
coming from. Apparently you have a problem with "militia" people. I'll tell=
 you this from my point of=20
view, with 26 years of military and goverment service, having sworn to prot=
ect and defend the=20
Constitution. I have been on both sides of this fence. The Constitution is =
first. Before anything else.=20
Militia people - those who fancy themselves as protectors of the Constituti=
on - are. They are very keen on=20
what is going on in the world today. They will be backed up by military mem=
bers should a "civil war" ever=20
occur in this country. The military will protect the Constitution first. Yo=
u see, the government is by, of=20
and for the people - meaning that people run it. People are part of this co=
untry and people are=20
corruptable, regardless of your belief that they aren't.=20

In the past six months, several illegal raids by the BATF have occurred in =
Mesa, Arizon. I will give you=20
the opportunity to look up the information yourself, because you won't find=
 it in the normal media. But=20
you will find that people like the Right to Keep and Bear Arms organization=
s have been tracking these=20
things. So, the government, run by people who make mistakes DO MAKE MISTAKE=
S. And they need to get their=20
act together before a lot more people become aware of their mistakes. I don=
't care if you're anti-gun or=20
not, that's fine. But if you are (not you personally, but "you" in the gene=
ric sense) then you are unaware=20
of the GOOD that guns can do - or simply do not care (this is not directed =
at you Michael, but the general=20
anti-gun people who say things similar to what you did).=20

And for the record - just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean people A=
RE NOT OUT TO GET YOU! Remember=20
that. A little paranoia goes a long way to keeping people honest. That is a=
 fact. In my current position,=20
if I WEREN'T paranoid, I couldn't get my job done!!!!!!!!!!!!=20

Albert Cattoir: Albert, I'm not sure if you were trying to teach me somethi=
ng or not. You didn't tell me=20
anything I did not already know and understand. Let me tell you something..=
. I have lived in Detroit=20
Michigan, Oklahoma City, Washington, DC and Colorado Springs - among other =
places. All of those places had=20
dozens of nuclear warheads pointed at them during the cold war. Some STILL =
have nukes aimed at them=20
(specifically where I live now, at NORAD. So, like you I've lived under tha=
t shroud as well.=20

I was there with Reagan and Bush. I wear a belt buckle George H. W. Bush ga=
ve me just prior to his=20

inaguration - not that it has bearing on this conversation, but it shows at=
 least to me and my family that=20
I've been there through some of the most important moments of history in th=
e 20th century. I was there=20
when the wall fell. I was there when the Iranian rescue mission failed. I w=
as there, and shot at several=20
times, during the contra days in the late '70s. I understand and fully aggr=
ee with the old SDI projects,=20
and now NMD. That's my job... I want it to succeed and work. I would love n=
othing more than to see nuclear=20

weapons become an obselete, even archane and useless weapon.=20

So, please do not assume that because you were there, the rest of us were n=
ot. As to your last comments....=20

[There will not be a limited Nuclear War in my estimation. Having all lived=
 through this 50 years of crap,=20
makes us not be interested by annoying people claiming this or that after h=
aving a Cold War with Russian=20
leaders. We are not amused at this type of behavior. This will not cause a =
Civil War, or a Nuclear War,=20
got it.]=20

In your estimation - opinion, there will not. In MY estimation - it CAN hap=
pen and will if the opportunity=20
presents itself to those who wish to see American fall.=20

Denial, however, is a symptom from which we all suffer from time to time. W=
e do not want to see bad things=20
come to pass and therefore deny it can possibly happen. Civil war can be ca=
used by many things. In our=20

country - a place considered by us Americans to be the best place in the wo=
rld to live, it hasn't happened=20

since the 1870s... a barbaric time in history. Now, we believe we are above=
 that. I hope we are. However,=20
look around you. Examine the distrust people have for a growingly powerful =
government that can arrest you=20
for even THINKING bad thoughts today. The so-called "Hate Crimes" bills the=
y keep trying to pass are a=20
good example. Who cares what you and I think about each other, or someone e=
lse? Only those who feel=20
"threatened" by our thoughts. Why should I bow down to someone who believes=
 I SHOULD NOT THINK A CERTAIN=20
WAY? Civil war is not only POSSIBLE in this country, if trends in social be=
havior continue, and government=20

continues to grow at an exponential rate, taking more and more of YOUR MONE=
Y then more and more people=20

will become dissatisfied.=20


266=20




Limited nuclear war is NOT impossible and under some circumstances, very pr=
obable. You seem to forget that=20
our national policy is to use nuclear weapons if attacked by anyone with an=
y weapons of mass destruction.=20
That is, if some city in the US, or military personnel (or embassy) were at=
tacked with nuclear, biological=20
or chemical weapons, our response would be swift, and severe. A nuclear str=
ike on the perpetrators WILL=20
happen. At that point it becomes a limited nuclear war. (If something I saw=
 yesterday has any truth, then=20
we were so close to a nuclear war during the Kursk incident, you people wil=
l pee your pants!)=20

John's being on this forum and making the claims he makes points out that t=
here are indeed social problems=20
today with which we all live. Those social problems, indeed the world probl=
ems we observe all around us=20
from Israel to Russia, from Central America to Washington DC show that we l=
ive in an unstable world, in=20
the 21st Century. Our actions - those actions of individuals - touch the li=
ves of many, many others around=20
us. People we know and do not know will be touched by one thing you do toda=
y.=20

If John is a time traveler, out of his own time line, then he exists here t=
oday because of something some=20
scientists did some time ago, just as some people, perhaps entire families =
DO NOT EXIST TODAY because of=20
the actions of some other scientists in 1945 at the Trinity site in New Mex=
ico.=20

Today might be the day that a new Einstein is born, or dies due to an accid=
ent. Today might be they day=20

impossible. Keeping our minds open to the possibilities of WHAT MIGHT BE on=

something.=20

Lola States: ((I postulate that you actually do not have any more of an adv=

I agree with this also.=20

The general public was informed about time travel around 2034. Yes, I have =
had conversations with other=20

less correct. I would say 60%=20

Your post brought to mind a conversation I had with a woman from Yugoslavia=

months before the war started there. She was very adamant that there could =
be no real civil strife.=20
Everyone got along very well, there were mixed marriages, mixed neighborhoo=

everything was very civilized. Not a year later they were in a full civil w=

things to one another.=20

This woman was a University philosophy professor who had spent her entire l=
ife in Yugoslavia.=20

As you say, anything can happen.=20

People are the same EVERYWHERE. It is foolish to imagine that things that h=

Lola... you're right, and I think you said what I was trying to say in a sh=
ort note. Thanks.=20

In America, we look around us and see a civilized society - where gangs, cr=
iminals and hoodlums carry guns=20
illegally every day, and USE THEM - but law-abiding, non-violent people are=
 denied the ease of obtaining=20
or carrying weapons with which to defend themselves.=20

Obviously, this is not everywhere. I think 37 states now have Right to Carr=
y laws now. Colorado, where I=20
live has limited issue licenses for concealed weapons.=20

The point here is that LITTLE things like this challenge us every day. Peop=
le somehow feel that "a new law"=20
will fix a problem, when really, only common sense - and an understanding o=
f previous laws would really=20
fix the problem. I bring the weapons situation up, because it is a daily co=
ncern in my life, as well as=20
the lives of many around me. It is a "hot button" issue for a LOT of people=
. You either want gun control=20
or you want no gun control.=20

There are those who want to be in the middle (like a certain Congressman wh=
o hears from me weekly anymore)=20
and concern yourself with "common sense gun laws" - which still ban guns to=
 some extent.=20

These hot button issues cause people to get upset and DO SOMETHING about th=
e situation. Sometimes one side=20
takes it futher than the other side, which then escalates the situation.=20

No... there is no reason to believe that we will never have another civil w=
ar in this country, and there is=20
definately no reason to believe there will never be a nuclear strike on our=
selves or another country.=20
Whether or not either of these scenarios would be survivalable is debatable=
 but moot - since the=20
possibilities exist that civil war, and/or nuclear war (whether limited or =
all-out) still exist.=20

The American or Western culture to which most of us posting here belong, ar=
e different in some ways than=20
other countries. But, we are all still human. Humans make mistakes, misinte=
rpert information, and humans=20
simply in large numbers have differences of opinions. Humans... kill their =
own kind too.=20

Don't get me wrong. I like the topic of time travel. Its been known that ev=
ery civilization that has had=20

, has been known to eventually=20
destroy themselves. The same way if we ever met a alien not from our Planet=

so has time travel. So, the end result is because we were exposed to this, =
this civilization as we know=20
it, destroys itself. The same question in a form is still asked today:=20

If a human walks outside and there is a dark cloud overhead, the human says=
 "I think I will grab an=20
umbrella, it may rain". The other human walking outside with the first huma=
n, says "You will not need an=20
umbrella, if no human exists, then no human will know that there was a dark=
 cloud overhead." Which type of=20
human are you, either one or both, or most important, to answer to yourself=

humanity will destroy itself, then maybe our prophecy will fulfill itself, =
if we think the other way, then=20

any form can be avoided. Let's take the scenarios that John lays out. A Civ=
il War needs a leader first.=20

How is this done? By groups hanging out in the invisible. Maybe. The Congre=
ss and President drafts=20
everyone it can, the military takes over at first, marshall law can be decl=
ared. What happens, leaders=20
take over, and the President is still left free to perform other duties lik=
e monitering Russia. Russia=20
supposedly attacks. How limited is the nuclear war. First it must be define=
d. Any kind of debate concludes=20
that you are assuming that some form of life exists when it is all over. Ho=
w many missiles is limited? 150=20
missiles. How many get through? Einstein used a thought experiment, or imag=
ined relativity. We shoot most=20
of the missiles down, so does Russia, China does not. Little wars start all=
 over the World. North and=20
South Korea, India and Pakistan. Use nuclear missiles. The US may bomb Iraq=
. Now how many missiles are=20
flying totally. Over 500 about. That may be just enough to end life on this=
 Planet. The oceans heat up,=20
the water recedes from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. The Polar Caps s=
tart melting, the oceans go up.=20
The magnetic pole of the Earth shifts, it goes too far. The Earth starts mo=
ving off it spin axis,=20
resulting in more destruction. Earthquakes now take place, the atmosphere d=
epletes letting water vapor out=20
into space. The land starts going under the water level. Animals turn on hu=
mans.=20

Elephants drop over, trample things. On and on, all because humans could no=
t imagine what the result would=20
be of even a limited nuclear war. Would humans survive this? I do not want =
to find out. There's seem to be=20
an emotion about having a limited nuclear war, that humans would survive, i=
t still takes thought=20
processes. Whatever they are feeling for that emotion is nothing that I wan=
t to be around. I am not their=20

slave. The result, life ends even if it takes just a little longer.=20

Banishing criminals to the past - an interesting thought.=20

I'm glad that there seems to be no evidence that that has happened. As it h=
appens, "criminals" are my=20
business and have been so for the past thirty-three years.=20

I'd have some very strong objections to sending them into the Stoneage (or =
any other prior age for that=20
matter). As it happens, there truly isn't a strong correlation between low =
intelligence and criminal=20
behavior. Criminals tend to be less educated but do possess at least averag=
e intelligence. If we were to=20
send them into the past we'd create a timeline where "modern" ingenuity and=
 "modern" man appear in (circa)=20

10, 000 BC...thus no Stoneage. Even with a limited education the banished w=
ould introduce the technical=20

skills of their chosen trades into that age (criminals really do have work =
skills - even skills that=20

qualify as "expert" by our standards.) It gets worse if you send them into =
a "pre-human" era. By fiat you=20

have re-defined "pre-human" to exclude that period from being "pre-human."=
=20

OT area:=20

I still see no practical applicability for time travel to our experience. I=
f it turns out that string or=20
bubble theory is true then time travel is possible - but the "place" travel=
ed to has no connection to our=20
reality. And a successful return trip from another bubble or string is tenu=
ous at best. One would have no=20
way of verifying that the timeline to which they returned was the same time=
line from which they left. If=20

it turns out that there is but one unified timeline, then any meddling with=
 the past (i.e. time traveling)=20

ends causality on the timeline from the instant of the Big Bang and renders=
 the timeline untenable - that=20
is, it precludes the formation of our universe. (The reason for positing th=
at causality ends at the=20
instant of the Big Bang is the result of contamination. If time travel is p=
ossible in a non-string/bubble=20
reality then the time line has the entirity of eternity for time travelers =
to contaminate the whole of the=20
time line. Causality fails at all instants on the time line and it collapse=
s before it forms. A macro=C2=AC=20
singularity of mass-energy &amp; space-time, as it were.)=20

Frankly, I'm probably no different than anyone else who logs onto the Time =
Travel threads. Thinking about,=20
fantasizing about and pondering the significance of time travel is fascinat=
ing. This facet of modern=20
theoretical physics and philosophy is the cutting edge of critical thought.=
=20

I suppose that time travel is so fascinating for me because everyone who po=
ses an opinion is potentially=20
correct - without exclusion. If time travel can be accomplished then it wil=
l be accomplished. Because our=20
timeline appears to be one where cause and effect are directly related then=
 it would appear that string-=20
bubble reality is proved in that context. Our four dimensional view of real=
ity is one (of an infinite=20
array of possibilities) where cause precedes effect. That may not be true o=
f other timelines.=20

Question=20

I have been a temporal researcher for at least two years now and mostly stu=
died radionic forms of time=20
travel. I personally have not yet used one of the devices but have heard st=
ories and evidence leading me=20
to think they work. I was also wondering if you have heard of any of the ra=
dionic and Steven Gibbs=20
devices. I have had a possible encounter with my future self that I can onl=
y characterize as being very=20
strange. He knew all my most personal thoughts and convinced me over a peri=
od of about a year that he was=20
me or atleast someone who knew me very well. Apparently he came from an alt=
ernate time line like you, and=20
his motive seemed more like an informational one to me. It appears at some =
point in time I might time=20
travel although I'm not sure. What he told me somewhat corresponds to what =
you say and that's what scares=20
me. I was hoping maybe it was just a future in another universe much differ=
ent from ours and that my=20
future would be some what peaceful and good to live in. I now see a picture=
 of a world that is war torn=20
and hard to live in. At first I was skeptical and then accepted you as bein=
g a true time traveler with all=20
the evidence and stories you put forth. I hope to maybe send a comment to m=
y future self and ask a couple=20
of questions. I would like to tell my future self this message: "Never forg=
et Echelon Group and the ones=20
you love you most, keep strong and don't give up." If his time line is anyt=
hing like mine, he'll know what=20
I mean. It's just something to keep his spirits up. Now for some questions,=
 is it possible that I some how=20
help any areas of time travel or get noticed in the future (Maybe recognize=
 my name)? Do most of the=20
people of that time die out, especially ones that currently have health pro=
blems? Is it possible that=20
sometime in your future or in your present time that time travel will be co=
mmon place? Have any of the=20
scientists of your time discovered any new planets, possibly ones with life=
? Has the bandwidth of the=20
internet increased greatly? And finally, one last question...how did Texas =
fare during the war (If you can=20
answer)? Thanks for your time...I hope maybe I can e-mail you or maybe I ca=

E. Robert Gonzalez,=20

I take it by your last name that your Spanish, am I right? I noticed from y=
our post that you believe John's=20
claims, that he's actually a bona-fined Time Traveler. You know, once I ask=
ed John a very similar question=20
to the one you just asked him. "Am I deeply involved in a Time Travel proje=
ct?" Knowing already the answer=20
to that question, he answered me by saying that he didn't know me. And that=
 if he did, he wouldn't tell=20
me.=20

To everyone:=20

I just wanted to emphasis to the whole public viewing these posts that John=
 still has not made it clear=20
what his secret agenda is. To allow our minds to accept what he says to be =
true, we accept the very=20
immorality of his secret agenda, whatever it may be.=20

He is a Time Traveler, most of you people believe. Do most of you also beli=
eve that he is sincere in=20
everything he says? Yet you forget that he said he would take people back w=
ith him.=20

I know that some of you wanted to volunteer. Yet John lied, and now your fa=
ith in him is still strong,=20
adjusting accordingly to keep his ideals true. Why am I the only one bringi=
ng this up, questioning him?=20
Maybe because I don't believe him, and because I won't be disappointed like=
 some of you if I find out he=20
isn't a Time Traveler. Reminds me of the Heaven's Gate movement all over ag=
ain.=20

That's pathetic isn't it? I know that some of you want to admit it; you're =
in the closet, thinking it over.=20
Whether he truly is, or isn't. You still have that doubt that refuses to an=
swer. You have a voice... don't=20
be afraid of using it and taking leadership.=20

Somebody has to be on the opposing side, am I to believe that I am the only=
 one?=20

John has many followers on his side; there is no doubt about that. But do y=
ou know what you are actually=20
following?=20

He has put his younger self in danger of someday being found out and exploi=
ted by our government. He has=20
exploited the opportunity of using the past to rowdy up events for some sec=
ret agenda he claims to have.=20
Saying he will video tape his departure, completely irresponsible of its re=
percussions. Just to name a=20
few.=20

The choice is ours people; our future is what we want it to be. Do most of =
you want a future where Time=20
Travel is a way of life? I know I don't, because how would you feel knowing=
 that your life is not yours to=20
dictate, but mainly what the future wants it to be.=20

I wouldn't dare think of exploiting the past, to benefit in some event in t=
he future. That goes against my=20
ethics. Obviously, some of you will have no problem with that, and ruin it =
for the rest of us. Gee, thanks=20

Gooten Tag - one and all.=20

I've just spent the worst weekend. Wish I could go back in time and correct=
 it.=20

Albert: First I want to address some things you said, but not your entire m=
essage. I'll try to keep my=20
comments brief.=20

"Let's take the scenarios that John lays out. A Civil War needs a leader fi=
rst. How is this done? By groups=20
hanging out in the invisible. Maybe."=20

There are already very, very large militia groups that formed around the ti=
me of the last elections. In=20
fact, the NRA is being considered a 'militia group' by some now. It grew by=
 millions prior to the=20
elections - mainly due to direct attacks on the right to keep and bear arms=
. Organizations such as the=20
Militia of Montana have gained hundreds of members in recent weeks. There a=
re others, that are larger.=20
There are leaders, there are invisible groups that even I don't know about =
(and I keep track of who's who=20
in the militia arena - for personal reason, nothing related to my job).=20

"The Congress and President drafts everyone it can, the military takes over=
 at first, marshall law can be=20
declared. What happens, leaders take over, and the President is still left =
free to perform other duties=20
like monitering Russia. Russia supposedly attacks. "=20

If and when Martial Law is declared - that will be the straw that breaks th=
e camel's back. The current=20
President KNOWS this, and CLinton knew it too. I surmise from his last acti=
ons (the pardons for instance)=20
that he felt the timing wrong for declaring martial law and would have if h=
e thought he could have=20
remained in office. Many of the groups I mentioned before were braced for p=
recisely that event. They are=20
braced for martial law. The biggest thing is that if martial law is declare=
d, some believe UN forces will=20
be brought in to suplement US forces. Why? Because foreigners do not have q=
ualms about shooting americans.=20
Keep that in mind if things start looking like they are moving toward that =
sort of thing.=20

John - can you... confirm from your point of view any of that? (Nothing spe=
cific there obviously) .=20

"How limited is the nuclear war. First it must be defined. Any kind of deba=
te concludes that you are=20
assuming that some form of life exists when it is all over. How many missil=
es=20

is limited? 150 missiles. How many get through? Einstein used a thought exp=
eriment, or imagined relativity.=20
We shoot=20

most of the missiles down, so does Russia, China does not. Little wars star=
t all over the World. North and=20
South Korea, India and Pakistan. Use nuclear missiles. The US may bomb Iraq=
. Now how many missiles are=20
flying totally. Over 500 about. That may be just enough to end life on this=
 Planet. The oceans heat up,=20
the water recedes from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. The Polar Caps s=
tart melting, the oceans go up.=20
The magnetic pole of the Earth shifts, it goes too far. The Earth starts mo=
ving off it spin axis,=20
resulting in more destruction. "=20

Obviously, all of this is supposition on both our parts. However, I agree w=
ith you about the "smaller=20
wars". As far as how many get through... right now, all of them. Life will =
exist when it is all over. You=20
know why? Because there have been many, many "Ice Ages" throughout our geol=
ogical history. There have been=20
at least 5, (I believe 6) major extinctions already in the history of our p=
lanet. Each time a major=20
extinction has occurred the dominate life forms were destroyed, and yet lif=
e continued to survive, then=20
thrive and finally a new, dominate life form took over. Each obviously more=
 intelligent than the last.=20

The last two involved dinosaurs and other higher lifeforms, and man is the =
latest incarnation of dominate=20
lifeform on this planet. Man is capable of total destruction of this world =
if man does so.=20

"There's seem to be an emotion about having a limited nuclear war, that hum=
ans would survive, it still=20
takes thought processes. Whatever they are feeling for that emotion is noth=
ing that I want to be around. I=20
am not their slave. The result, life ends even if it takes just a little=20

longer."=20

Emotion is the main ingredient in any war, regardless of whether or not it =
is nuclear or conventional.=20
People get mad, they fight, they argue and eventually they go to war as a=
=20

group/country/nation/race/religion/etc. The thought processes change radica=
lly from "let's get along" to=20
"those BASTARDS" to "let's kill them all" and then back to a very organized=
 thought process of how best to=20
kill the enemy.=20

But, the part that precipitates a war takes very little effort or thought o=
n the part of the antagonists.=20
They simply let their emotions take over. When it gets too far, war starts =
and after the beginning of the=20

war - the thoughts turn to killing, not how to get out of the war.=20

Nuclear weapons are the ultimate device with which to put a stop to a war. =
As such they won't be used until=20
they are deemed absolutely necessary. But, once a war begins, the possibili=
ty exists, and as low as the=20
probabilities might seem, they are always much higher than any of us believ=
e.=20

As we can see from this forum alone, the human mind grabs hold of ideas tha=
t are on the fringe and believes=20
them. But thoughts that are scary, deadly and even point to the real truth =
about humanity (how bad and=20

evil people can be if they want) we try to deny those possibilities. We do =
not wish to believe that the=20

human race is capable of some of the evil that we've seen in the past.=20

So - we try to deny it. My point throughout this forum, to everyone includi=
ng you and Javier is that even=20
if you do not BELIEVE in something, do not believe it can happen, you STILL=
 MUST keep your mind open to=20
the possibilities because then you are forewarned. Forewarned is forearmed.=

whether foreigner will kill=20

Written by Thomas Jefferson, June 1776, :=20

When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to=
 dissolve the political bonds=20
which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of t=
he earth, the separate and=20
equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them,=
 a decent respect to the=20
opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impe=
l them to the separation.=20

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, th=
at they are endowed by their=20
Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty=
 and the pursuit of happiness.=20

That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving=
 their just powers from the=20

consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destr=
uctive to these ends, it is the=20
right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new governm=
ent, laying its foundation on=20
such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall se=
em most likely to effect their=20
safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long =
established should not be=20
changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath=
 shown that mankind are more=20

disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by=
 abolishing the forms to which=20

they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursu=
ing invariably the same object=20
evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right=
, it is their duty, to throw=20
off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. =
=E2=80=94 Such has been the patient=20
sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrain=
s them to alter their former=20
systems of government.=20

The thinking has all been done, still the questions will always be asked. W=
hat is the meaning of life?=20

There a glimpse of it from Thomas Jefferson.=20

Very nicely put Albert. I agree with Thomas Jefferson. We must do something=
. The way things are going, lots=20
of people are just letting the government do things to us. No body takes en=
ough of a stand anymore in=20
matters of the government taking away our rights, our freedom. Look at the =
picture our resident Time=20

of life to their government and people, and for what hidden agenda?=20

I'll bet you'll have some very interesting stories to tell your government =
about us when you go back John .=20

And in conclusion, Thomas Jefferson wrote:=20

In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the m=

petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose chara=
cter is thus marked by every=20
act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.=
=20

Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warn=
ed them from time to time of=20
attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over =
us. We have reminded them of=20
the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed t=
o their native justice and=20
magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to=
 disavow these usurpations,=20
which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. We mu=
st, therefore, acquiesce in the=20
necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the re=

The US is backed by NUCLEAR WEAPONS.=20

I think its safe to assume that the people who bought and paid for these we=

No, these weapons do not make the World safe, but I do know where I might b=

Well talk about streching the truth. John was direct in claims of being a T=
ime Traveler, everyone knew I=20
was intentive in exposing him. If that method is to give the example of "Wh=
at if you were a Time Traveler"=20
"what would you do if" and so on, does not mean I believe he is, if it gave=
 you and him the impression=20
that I believed him. I think that's where you misunderstood me and all this=
 started.=20

I can do very well without bringing up what you said, I know what you mean.=
 People can make up their own=20
minds. But you must let them choose. Not just let them have 1 side of a sub=
ject to choose.=20

Me being quiet, will just leave 1 side. Your side. And that is what I have =
been trying to make you be aware=20

Moreover, did you think I cared what John has said to you about me. NO! Hav=

Just because I said it wasn't fair, does not mean I want others to feel sor=

John and all, I have been reading with fascination this thread for a few we=
eks now. Are you a Time=20
Traveler, John? I do not know. You make an interesting and compelling case,=
 regardless of whether I or=20
anyone else believes that you are.=20

The whole concept of time travel =E2=80=94 with its myriad possibilities du=
e to an action occurring in one brief=20
moment =E2=80=94 is mind-boggling. To imagine for a moment that a single ev=
ent sets off unforeseen consequences,=20

and knowing that this happens in infinite numbers at all times, can be quit=
e humbling.=20

Take, if you will, a chain of events which happened to me within the past d=
ay. While proceeding to get my=20
two year old a cup of milk last evening, I somehow managed to lose the cap =
off of the milk carton. My wife=20
then poured the milk into a pitcher and placed it back inside the refrigera=
tor. This morning my two year=20
old went to help himself to another cup of milk, and you guessed it, he dro=
pped the pitcher spilling the=20
contents all over our kitchen floor. This made me 10 minutes later beginnin=
g my commute to work, and=20
possibly saved my life as I was not involved in a car accident that occurre=
d where I normally would have=20
been had I left at my normal time.=20

I only mention the above because it seems that even the fact of my encounte=
ring this thread on this website=20
seems to all be interconnected somehow.=20

This brings me to another point. I have been very moved by some of John's a=
ccounts, as well as others, in=20
relation to the projected upcoming strife and war. I said I have a two year=
 old boy, which means he is the=20

approximate same age as John. If these prognostications are true, then I ce=
rtainly do not like what is=20

foreboded for my children.=20

I, personally, am not surprised at this picture because I have foretold thi=
s scenario myself, not by=20
implementing any time traveling means, but through observation and analysis=
. A person only needs to look=20
at the recent presidential election to see that a war is a distinct possibl=
itiy involving rural America=20
versus the cities. Look at how the electoral college played out. A1 Gore ca=
rried the heavily populated=20
east and west coasts, with the rural areas between basically favoring Georg=
e W. Bush. The mainstream media=20
tried to portray this as proving how close to the "center" the electorate i=
s. I, however, hold an opposing=20
viewpoint in that I believe it shows just how polarized we have become. The=
 rural areas want more of a=20
traditional America with traditional family values. I predicted an imminent=
 violent uprising even before=20
the election, and I still hold to this belief. I hope I am wrong.=20

Do I own a gun? No, but I certainly support the Second Amendment and a pers=
on's right to do so.=20

Take care all of you, and God bless America!=20

All very interesting David up previous. I really do not see rural America r=
eally interested in starting an=20
uprising. What is bothering people to me, is constant lay-offs and the chan=
ging of life in the Information=20
Age. Some refuse to need this new kind of thinking, ushered in by people us=
ing computer more. This grand=20
thing called the computer to make life easier has also had its drawbacks. I=
 wish that America would look=20
into a Think Tank type of operation for thinking about issues and quality f=
irst, but then I guess that=20
would not be America anymore. People I guess, feel that they are shoved aro=

different than previous management from the past. The social problems are a=
 relatively few individuals,=20
whom other people hear more about on the news.=20

I suggest everyone listen to talk-radio more, only a few shows on TV are wo=
rth watching.=20

As one person put it, greed is driving America, and some feel at the loss o=
f interaction between people.=20
People have their opinions, but like arse-holes, everyone got one, and for =
the most part, opinions are=20
just a form of belief system held by the individual. People see panic where=
 there may be none.=20

I put it this way, upper management looks at America and the way individual=
s are acting and says "I put the=20
operation overseas", well, at least to me.=20

Its all concerned with how much of the moola people can have. That may not =
lead to anything. Combined with=20
taxes and people talk about change.=20

The best way is still the old way, write your Congress People and keep at i=

is ordinary too.=20

Life could be a lot harder, we have become slack for saying lack of money t=

How does time travel affect our future(no pun intended) exploration of the =

Prove what? All I did was point out John's discrepancies. I think it's proo=

he's said in past post, and what he says now. It doesn't match up.=20

First things first: Prove what? Well, that you can prove anything, for star=
ters.=20

Discrepancies in written material isn't proof enough of anything.=20

It certainly is important information, and thanks for pointing out what you=
 have.=20

But please stop pretending it is proof of anything.=20

There still is room for AT LEAST a reasonable doubt, both ways, here . . . =
and the generally accepted norm=20

is to assume an individual not-guilty of a crime until they can be prooven =
guilty without a reasonable=20
doubt.=20

Timetravel ain't a crime, I'm fairly certain.=20

But lying certainly seems like one.=20

So lets assume John not-guilty of lying about being a time-traveler until y=
ou can prove to us that he isn't=20
without a reasonable doubt.=20

You still won't be able to prove it absolutely though, so don't pretend you=
 can.=20

And, just so you know, I don't think the above is a proof, but I do think i=
t elliminates many reasonable=20
doubts about my argument.=20

Lets let John and my fellow 'lemmings' talk philosophy, physics and about t=

a bit on the evil-timetraveler rhetoric, OK?=20

&lt;&lt;However, I am not Trott and this name and TTO are the only names I'=

name here, have you considered its origin from another word-play standpoint=
? For example, TITOR could=20
equal TIme-Travel-OR.=20

After looking at your name Mr. Darby, I can pull out "MEET ME TAR BABY" whi=

to the Song of the South. In that case, are you telling us in a secret way =
that you are trying to distract=20
us by fooling us in the bre'r patch? &gt;&gt;=20

Actually, John, I did consider Time-Travel-OR based on the moniker TimeTrav=
el_0 elsewhere. I didn't=20
consider that as a possibility as it begs the question, "Time Travel-OR wha=
t?"=20

It's never been my motivation to attack your veracity. Whether you are an a=
ctual time traveler or not=20
doesn't concern me. I did consider that you might have opted to create your=
 own foil in Trott (or even=20
Javier) to create a sophistic dialogue through which your message is delive=
red. You and Trott - Phaedo and=20
Echerates of Phlius: instead of discussing the four arguments of immortalit=

of Socrates, you discuss the possibility of time travel and the society of =

still find you to be humorous and thought inspiring.=20

Oh, the anagram of my name: Emmett is my first name and "Darby" is a nickna=

So I guess however you put it, we can't prove anything here. And in the end=

I personally don't believe him, but you and others may think other wise. I =

throughout the country.=20

Here's an excerpt. I hope Mr. Hamner does not mind=20

"I was talking to a dear friend of mine last night. He seemed very upset so=
 I asked what was up and if I=20
could help.=20

He related that his 14 year old son was now in the custody of the police. I=
 asked what had happened. He=20
then told that his son and some other boys had just gotten into paintball. =
On the school bus they'd talk=20
about the games they were playing. The bus driver understood that it was on=

driver told the boys that "they were just plain evil" at that my friends so=

was evil I'd shoot you" (not smart in todays enviroment), this happen monda=

I'm with Javier on this one. Other than being just another guy on the stree=
t what difference does it make=20
what John feels about the four incidents (count 'em, four) you referred to?=
=20

There wasn't a rash of incidents. There was one major incident at a school =
followed by editors running as=20
lead stories anything that involved a kid and a weapon nationwide. No San D=
iego incident =3D no "rash" (the=20
wire services wouldn't pick up on the stories) And a small correction. Unle=
ss UC Santa Cruz ALSO had four=20
students run over, it was UC Santa Barbara (actually in Isla Vista) where t=
he students were run over -=20
about two miles from my home and 250 miles from Santa Cruz.=20

Posted by Albert Cattoir on 03-09-2001 01:18 AM=20

According to a talk-show host that looked all over the country and was talk=
ing about it on his show, there=20
was a "rash" of incidents with school kids. Let's see, Thursday.=20

I think the kids think its "cool" to be able to talk to their other peers a=
nd tell them about what they do.=20
Well, something has to be done about this. I would tell you what the talk-s=
how host and others blame it=20
on, but that would probably start a debate that never ended. Some parents w=
ere acting strange also.=20

Parents taking a base-ball bat to school to, I guess, be arrested. Strange =
people. Try the relaxation=20
response. It takes time to work, maybe a month, be when you feel deeper rel=
axed, you will know.=20

Concentrate on your breathing and quiet your brain activity so you dwell on=

just out without dwelling on life's problems. Negative thoughts you have to=
 consciously do, it takes=20
practice, say cancel, cancel to yourself should one come in. In a quiet pla=

20 minutes.=20

Something else needs to be taught to kids in school.=20

What has all this to do with time travel?=20

Actually... there was a rash of incidents. I'm aware of seven different thi=
ngs that happened here in Colorado=20
yesterday, alone. I'm certain there were dozens of other such incidents thr=
oughout the country yesterday.=20

Here we had 2 bomb threats, 3 "civil disturbances" at other schools in othe=
r areas, and there was a kid=20
here that placed a "fake bomb" in a school in Colorado Springs. There was r=
eference to something else like=20
a gun being found in another school somewhere, but I didn't catch the locat=
ion.=20

So., that was just MY state. How about other states?=20

Posted by Rick Donaldson on 03-09-2001 07:03 AM=20

I need to continue this thought here. First of all, we have in most of our =
school systems something called=20
a "Zero Tolerance Policy". This equates to a "Zero Common Sense Policy" bas=
ed upon the busdriver incident=20
alone. Anyone listing to the kids talk would understand the kid didnt make =
a threat, he made a statement.=20

We have a society where political correctness (read: Thought Control) is th=
e norm. Kids aren't allowed to=20
carry a pocket knife (I carried a HUNTING KNIFE on my belt when I was in gr=
ade school, in Kentucky... as I=20
walked through the woods to school. No one ever said ANYTHING to be about i=
t.)=20

Anything that can be construed as a weapon is banned, even if it isn't a we=
apon.=20

The media has the attitude that banning this or that is newsworthy (i.e. gu=
ns, kids getting in to fights in=20
school etc).=20

So, what we really have (all of this above, plus all the other little thing=
s that nag at us every day) is a=20
society waiting for something bigger to trigger something else.=20

Now, I'm not saying that we're waiting for that civil war, but I AM saying =
that we have placed ourselves in=20
a very sensitive, precarious position by making everything so "hair-trigger=
" likely to put something else=20
into motion.=20

Time moves forward for us, and those nodal points of change can be anywhere=
 in our future.=20

Greetings everyone. I do plan to get to the questions soon. I have been qui=

In my travels over your web, I came across this section of a speculative ne=

John,=20

A comment from "the intel department". I follow global intelligence extreme=
ly closely. Some of us in my=20
security community believe that Mad Cow disease is not speculative terroris=
m, it is fact. No proof, but=20
many, many talking points on the subject can show it. I'll give you some ex=
amples.=20

1) The west uses more beef/red meat products than ANY OTHER COUNTRY - in fa=
ct more than most other=20
countries put together.=20

2) Eco-terrorism, by some of the anti-meat eaters has been considered, but =
at the same time, it is not=20
conducive to them to kill animals, because the majority of non-meat eaters =
in western culture believe=20
"animals have rights" and would consider such a thing a type of genocide.=
=20

3) Biological warfare is indeed the greatest threat to our society. It is c=
heap, easy to produce, easy to=20
release, and most importantly... biological warfare is "Stealth Warfare". B=
iological agents can be released=20
as an aerosol, into water, into food.=20

4) What better way to destroy a country than to screw up their food sources=
. By creating a messed up animal=20
supply, you thrust the prices of meat skyward, quickly. You cause the produ=
ction to drop, loss of wages,=20
loss of profit, loss of food supplies. You put a strain on several other fo=
od sources to take up for the=20
lost portion of production.=20

5) A sudden and deadly resurgence of a disease that hasn't really been a pr=
oblem for decades is a very=20
obvious attack. This is the very reason people believe things like AIDS is =
a biological agent that got=20
loose on society. It appeared quickly in the 80s. It could not be traced, a=
nd what little tracing they=20
showed, claimed it came from "monkeys" or apes or something (I don't recall=
 the specifics at this point).=20
However, AIDS like other such diseases can not simply "begin to exist" with=
out mutations or some other=20
intervention. Mad Cow disease, as well as Hoof and Mouth disease (what we c=
all it in America - they call=20
it Foot and Mouth in the UK) has suddenly appeared with a vengence. The for=
mer is a relatively new=20
disease. The latter is very old, but, was pretty much wiped out. Suddenly, =
it is back.=20

So, we have two things specifically in the UK that are attacking hoofed cre=
ature. Both of which are either=20
new or resurgences of old diseases. These diseases came about at roughly th=
e same time, and spread=20
rapidly.=20

I believe (and I've not had a lot of time to research it, but then, I'm bet=
ting it will be very difficult=20
right now to track it precisely) that this most recent outbreak occured in =
several places simultaneously.=20
If so, it was definately a planned and probably well carried-out attack.=20

America is NEXT. But, not only will it be something like Hoof and Mouth, Ma=
d Cow something else will likely=20
be introduced as well. Swine flu, something that attacks chickens and perha=
ps some kind of wheat blight.=20
That would hit MAJOR portions of our food supplies, causing all the aforeme=
ntioned problems, plus more.=20

A major economic crash is likely. THis would weaken the US to a great exten=
t opening us up for other types=20
of attacks.=20

Currently America is under attack by several former states of the Soviet Un=
ion, many arab states and=20
terrorist organizations already. They are coming in through computers and n=
etworks, probing constantly,=20
looking for weaknesses, testing our defenses and looking for the proper tim=
e and place to make a major=20
attack.=20

Things to watch:=20

A) Increased internet attacks.=20

B) A MAJOR attack on the internet.=20

C) Sudden outbreak of any sort of weird animal diseases.=20

D) Increased readiness of the military in the US.=20

E) Increased movements of the military in the US.=20

F) Increased public awareness of police force training, particularily in co=
mputer attacks, raids finding=20
"illegal guns".=20

G) Attacks on "militia groups" again.=20

When the latter occurs, be prepared for the Pro-Consitution forces to get l=
oud, and "in-your-face"=20
attitudes. They will not stand for more attacks on the Second Amendment.=20

Anyway - those are from my point of view. Whether I am completely accurate =
or not, remains to be seen.=20
However, I believe my data is accurate, and I am not usually wrong on the "=
big picture".=20

You say that you wear some kind of flight suit like coveralls when you are =

Javier,=20

Being in a free country dictates that certain people will do certain experi=

complain's about it. The rest of us are left to decide other alternative ac=
tions to prevent these leaps of=20
technology from interferring with humanity on (as) a whole. I had little ch=
oice in the making of a atom=20
bomb. If the US did not do it, than it is probable that Hilter would have. =
With that, things in the future=20
would be indeed different. So, as with anything, we are (forced, as in War)=
 to do a certain number of=20
things. In peace, we are still (forced) to see what other countries are up =
to. The fear of America is that=20
if we fall behind, then someone someway will take control of us. In the cas=
e of the Middle East, I suppose=20
that would be Saddam. In the case of a time traveler, I doubt he could achi=
eve such a possibility unless=20
he knew every "connection" to change the events of history. That part was d=
escribed in that book by=20
Jonathan Burke in the book "Connections". I make no commitment as to the mo=
rality of time travel. Someone=20
will do it, if it's possible, someday. Otherwise, we have no freedom. We ar=

Dear Fellow Time Travelers:=20

In about 30 days, I will be leaving this worldline to return home to 2036. =
I first want to say thank you=20
for the wonderful conversation and insight into your society. I have learne=
d a great deal and my opinion=20
on quite a few things has changed dramatically.=20

I will finish the questions that have been posted on this site up to this d=
ate. Unfortunately, I must now=20
spend my spare time preparing to leave and I will not be on the computer ve=
ry much. I do however want to=20
repeat my offer and add a slight twist.=20

After going over my flight plan home, I have discovered my VGL holdover per=
iod is a bit longer than I=20
expected. I will be spending at least three weeks in April of 1998 as I mak=
e my way back to 1975.=20
Therefore, I not only offer you the chance to leave a message to yourself i=
n 2036 but I offer you the=20
chance to leave yourself a message in 1998. I will take any compiled messag=
es and email addressees you=20
provide and send them on the net when I get to 1998.=20

Granted, this will not affect you on your worldline now but you make take s=
ome comfort that another "you"=20
on another worldline has the advantage of knowing something you wish you kn=
ew three years ago. Based on=20
the earlier questions I've seen, I've decided a day-to-day record of the Do=
w a day in advance should=20
convince you that the messages are real in 1998.=20

In addition, I am hopeful a series of photocopies and photographs will be a=
vailable for you that may give=20
you more insight into the technology of the distortion unit. I will let you=
 know the address of the site=20
when it is available. I also plan to have my parents videotape my departure=
. If they succeed, it will also=20
be posted after I leave.=20

I look forward to these last few weeks with my family and I will check in p=

Well I had a hard time getting through what all your rhetoric was about. An=
d still didn't see you actually=20
answer my question. "Where do you stand?" Well that's not important now, as=
 I see that you believe John=20
Titor, A.k.a. TT_0 is for real. So thank you for proving my point correctly=
.=20

Hypocrisy I tell you.=20

First you came off as inspirational, speaking with convictions about right =
and wrong. But in the end,=20
you're only as much a hypocrite as the rest of us are.=20

I however do not tolerate immoralities on any level, and I live my life acc=
ording to basic human law.=20
Compassion and principal our my guiding truths. "We the people" should real=
ize this, and not accept what=20
is basically wrong. There have been to many compromises, too much acceptati=
on. But the truth is clear,=20
that despite all of what we are trying to accomplish, of becoming an advanc=
e civilization and people, we=20
are failing in the worst possible way. And that is by following our princip=
les.=20

Just think about that...=20

John,=20

I see you finally made your big pre-farewell speech. Very nice, you almost =
made me feel sorry to see you=20
go. Then I remembered what you are. An opportunist.=20

Well wherever you go, just remember me! And know that wherever you stand, t=

though, if all these alternate timelines are so similar... Then shouldn't a=

that is so, then another "you"=20
would go back to our timeline in 1998 per se and we'd actually get the mess=

Posted by Rick Donaldson on 03-11-2001 12:58 PM=20

After spending the last few days working on family business and keeping my =
mind busy thinking about time=20
traveling, from John's point of view, I have come to a sudden and surprisin=
g conclusion.=20

John is perhaps what he says he is... however, I don't think he is a "TIME =
TRAVELER" - I think he is a world=C2=AC=20
line, or for lack of a better word, a dimension traveler.=20

I say this based on a couple of assumptions. His machine uses gravity calcu=
lations/measurements to maintain=20
his "physical position".=20

But, he claims there is up to a 2.5 % divergence from his reality.=20

That means to me that:=20

1) He is NOT on his 'reality" but on ours.=20

2) He will be going back to his reality - or at least pretty close to it.=
=20

3) Our reality is not precisely his reality.=20

4) There are multiple worlds, multiple time lines if you will and he is no =
longer on his orginal one.=20

5) Anything he does here on our time line will NOT EFFECT OUR TIME LINE EXC=
EPT locally (time related). That=20
is, if he were to kill someone's grandparents here, they would NOT cease to=
 exist on HIS time line. They=20
would here though. If he goes back to 1975 and does this, OUR grandparents =
will be JUST FINE. It is the=20
ones on the time line where he stopped.=20

6) John's machine uses tipler cylinders - somehow. I believe it would be ve=
ry possible to create a tipler=20

cylinder using singularities. A physcist I know confirmed my suspicions on =
Friday-last. He stated that=20

such a machine could be built now. He said that it would take some strong s=
cientific work on the part of=20

linear accelerator scientists though, and so far as he knew, it hasn't been=
 accomplished YET, but will be=20
in the very near future.=20

7) If microsingularities are made, they can be held in 'statis' or in a mag=
netic field in a vacuum.=20

According to my physcist that is. If so, it would be possible to effect the=
m with magnetic fields in such=20
a manner as to allow them to interact with each other (on that micro scale)=
.=20

8) If so - then it might be very possible to speed up, slow down or even ST=
OP time altogether. In fact, he=20

believes it possible to reverse time altogether.=20

9) The effects of using such a machine would be that "high gravitational fi=
elds would be present around the=20
machine". However, at this point, neither myself, him nor other folks we ta=
lked to could come up with a=20
way to measure gravity fields with any reliable method. (Scales, things lik=
e that work, but... that is=20
rather crude I think).=20

10) Anything within the field of a tipler cylinder would be carried along w=
ith the device... the method of=20
"travel" would or could be based on voltages applied to the magentic fields=
 in some manner as to cause a=20
change in the rotation of the field.=20

11) John's machine will not take him back in time. It takes him to a diffen=
t time LINE, in a different=20
world, on a different plane of existence.=20

Anyway, that's my 2-cents worth. Perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps I'm right. No m=
atter if John is a real TT or=20
not is moot at this point.=20

John... take this message back in time to 1998 and ... how do you propose t=
o see that we get these messages=20
anyway????=20

Rick, you are absolutely right. And, what John Titor has said reflects exac=

allel realities in the same or=20

, however, the closest thing=20

al beliefs and experience.=20

Simply put, the most powerful component of ANY interaction or activity invo=
lving humans is the human will.=20
Because humans make hundreds or thousands of decisions everyday, most very =
minor and immediately=20
forgettable, the possibilities of potential outcomes to ANY situation in wh=
ich one is involved is subject=20
to randomness (chaos?). Our own personal decisions are influenced by a mult=
itude of factors such as mood,=20
health, weather, stress, intelligence, finances, family, interactions with =
other people, past experience,=20
future expectations, hopes, personal and societal myths...the list could be=
 endless.=20

And, of course, we are subjected not only to the outcomes of our OWN decisi=
ons but also to those of others.=20
For example, one poster noted that a simple and common occurrence with a ch=
ild potentially helped him=20
avoid a tragedy. If one accepts that my statements are true, then it requir=
es no giant leap of faith to=20
also agree that this randomness prevents anyone from EVER predicting a futu=
re event that involves the=20
decisions of humans.=20

Let us assume for the moment that John is indeed a traveler from 2036 and t=
hat all his statements are 100%=20
fact. Within his own timeline, these major occurrences of a civil war and a=
 nuclear holocaust have=20
occurred and, based on a randomness factor of 2.5% one could speculate that=
 the same could occur here. We=20
do, after all, have the SAME people involved. However, 2.5% is a HUGE varia=
ble given the already=20
incalculable odds that a small decision by a child, for instance, could cha=
nge the whole scenario or=20
outcome.=20

History is rife with stories of decisions that seemed meaningless at the ti=
me averting or causing major=20
disasters or occurrences. We even have several words and terms to describe =
these things: luck, misfortune,=20
angel on my shoulder, God watching over me, wrong place/wrong time, caught =
a break, etc. In fact, one of=20
our favorite pastimes as humans is "what if". Given these factors, it is li=
ttle wonder that John will not=20
give short-term "hard facts"...because he doesn't really KNOW! And, I specu=
late he knows he doesn't know.=20
Just because Duke, for instance, won the NCAA tournament in 2001 in his tim=
eline is no assurance the same=20
will happen here (if they and their opponent score 150 points total in the =
championship game, nearly 4=20
points or 2.5% are going SOMEWHERE..add decision making under stress and th=
ere is simply no WAY that an=20
outcome could be predicted with certainty).=20

Regardless, whether OUR future is the future that John "remembers" or not, =
the randomness of human will and=20
the factors impacting it will insure a different outcome, for better or wor=
se, in this timeline. Different=20
decisions cause different actions which nearly always render different resu=
lts.=20

Very good post. I wish you had been able to be here all the time. You have =
drawn some conclusions that are=20
thought provoking regarding John's or anyone's ability to predict the futur=
e.=20

I, for one, take what many many find to be a simplistic view of time travel=
 theory, and that is that should=20
time travel become available, there is nothing any time traveler can do to =
change or alter anyone's=20
timeline because it already has happened. I guess I would add that if my th=
eory is true, Javier, then you=20
have nothing in which to worry regarding John or any other Time Traveler.=

There is a difference between a John Titor supporter and a person who belie=

traveller .=20

I support John Titor in his effort to have a discussion in this thread.=20

I've reserved judgement about his veracity because there is simply no way o=
f knowing, and very little to be=20
gained by guessing, even if I guess right.=20

Frankly, I don't think it matters whether he is hoaxing us or not.=20

It is the interaction and exchange that occurs here that matters.=20

Why is it that the moment I question the nature of reality and ask you to d=

lovin' liberal-satanist wannabee in your eyes?=20

Javier, I am unique, friend. There are only one 'of me out there in this wo=

People will complain about anything and everything, as you now are proving.=

Norms do not exist.=20

I never voted for Bill Clinton =E2=80=94 your wrong on that one too.=20

I don't see how you can know how I stand on genetic engineering and human c=
loning when haven't even decided=20
for certain =E2=80=94 you really are amazing.=20

Next time you chose to share a diatribe with us, please don't engage in cha=
racter assassination as you do=20
so. It makes it hard to see that much of what you say agrees with the way I=
 see things.=20

If you really are against John Titor and rational discussion in this thread=
, calling names is the best way=20
to declare your alignment.=20

Once again Javier, I must ask you (and I direct this at everybody else too)=
: Why are you so certain that=20
you do have a firm grasp on reality? Are you sure you see and understand al=
l things very clearly? How do=20
you know what you know?=20

Indeed, do I know what needs to be fixed?=20

At times I feel I do, and I often act upon my beleifs and impulses in an at=
tempt to 'fix' the world . . .=20

but, at other times, I wonder whether its me or the world that needs fixing=
 . . .=20

Proving things is impossible in this realm.=20

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.=20

It means the reward is in the trying.=20

The idea is to keep learning (ad infinitum) until you finally do know evert=
hing. And not to stop when=20
convenient and declare that the end has been reached.=20

Lets talk about the possibilities, since there are no certainties.=20

Excuse this outburst, it just felt right at the time.=20

Its not over till the fatlady sings John.=20

Red face=20

There have been almost 19,000 views of these posts since its inception and =
that alone gives credit to the=20
number of people who are interested in this topic.=20

Given the extreme interest (and it is extreme) and the number of people who=
 no doubt repeatedly visit here=20
(as I do) even if not to always post, but to READ... that is incredible.=20

John has stated he is 'leaving' in about 30 days. Someone else is critical =
of that. If John said he was=20
going on a two month Time travel excursion for a particular reason, someone=
 else would be critical. If=20
John said he's making some kind of adjustment to his devices, someone would=
 be critical. Hmm.=20

Given that there is in my view no problem in relating information by John -=
 given the odds that his=20
timeline deviates from ours by around a possible 2.5%, it would seem fair t=
o this threads viewers for John=20
to provide a thorough discourse on what his timeline offers (afterall John,=
 there's no way you can be=20
judged on that given your noted deviance.)=20

It seems most of us are acting as if its the last goodbyes - but don't forg=
et he gave us 30 days (or given=20
himself the same.) Can we not make use of that (whether he is or is not a T=
T is irrelevant.)=20

Perhaps final concrete questions could be answered at this time? We'll see.=
 There's nothing to loose is=20

((It is the interaction and exchange that occurs here that matters. ))=20

Even if that interaction is generating a group of people following him, pra=
ising him, looking up to him as=20
this perfect role-model? It could all just be a front, but they don't care.=
 They should however be made=20
aware of this. Just look at how those people in "Heaven's Gate" felt toward=
s their founder? Mighty similar=20
to what is happening here, and it makes me sick to see it.=20

I am reminded of this quote. I don't know who said it, just got it out of s=
ome book with quotes: "Use your=20
eyes. Sometimes those who offer us eternal salvation surround themselves wi=
th dead plants."=20

How many people here wish they could go with John in to the future?=20


294=20


How is that any different then those people who wanted to get on the Hale-B=
op spaceship to Heaven?=20

((Why is it that the moment I question the nature of reality and ask you to=
 do the same, I become a nazi-=20
lovin' liberal-satanist wannabee in your eyes?))=20

Because you and lots of people are 1 sided individuals, who can't conceive =
the possibility that I can=20
actually be right about John and Time Travel.=20

((I am not perfect, nor do I pretend to be. ))=20

I agree, I'm not either.=20

((I never voted for Bill Clinton =E2=80=94 your wrong on that one too. ))=
=20

I said: "You're perhaps the majority of people who voted for Bill Clinton t=

say you did.=20

((If you really are against John Titor and rational discussion in this thre=
ad, calling names is the best=20
way to declare your alignment. ))=20

Is there something wrong in what I am trying to accomplish here? Am I not t=
rying my hardest too?=20

I am also reminded of this quote: "Give the world the best you have, and it=
 may never be enough. Give the=20
world the best you've got anyway."=20

((At times I feel I do, and I often act upon my beleifs and impulses in an =
attempt to 'fix' the world . . .=20

but, at other times, I wonder whether its me or the world that needs fixing=
 . . . ))=20

So your uncertain, I'm not. I know what needs to be fixed. I've seen it, I =
still see it. If you only knew...=20

And for the last time, yes I do have a firm grasp of reality. But if you wi=
sh not to accept that answer,=20
because it's not to your expectation, then I ask you to please stop asking =
it, for I will not answer it=20
again. Because there will not be a good enough answer for you, no matter wh=
at I say.=20

((Proving things is impossible in this realm.))=20

I can prove things in this realm. Something's are harder then others though=
.=20

((The idea is to keep learning (ad infinitum) until you finally do know eve=

The end will come when justice is served. I am merely trying to see that ju=
stice gets served in the mean=20
while. Cops do it all the time; do you blame them for doing their job? I se=
e something wrong, I have to=20
help. I can't let someone down, especially if there is something I can do a=

I will certainly miss this post when Johns gone . Maybe we can keep it aliv=

this thread you'll notice I've tried to keep a lighter side to my responses=
, mostly stupid comments meant=20
to break up the intense scrutiny some people have put John under.=20

As far as the most verbal of John's critics, Javier Cortez, if I'm not mist=
aken he has posted his age on=20
the birthday thread as being 21 years old. That could explain a lot. Now ag=
e is not that relevant, but=20
maturity rarely comes at that age. He is not a "Time Cop" as he states, rat=
her he probably harbors that=20
fantasy. This is not an attack or threat or anything of the sort. Just a st=
atement of fact.=20

As far as John goes, it would be great if he is who he said he was. I canno=
t pass judgement on him. All I=20
can do is thank him for this most interesting thread and wish him "God Spee=

Well, not yet. We (what do you mean we, human?) have lived through some dif=
ficult times (from the past).=20

But still the fact remains that somehow, humans have gotten through it.=20

One could say that the probability of having a War increases since we have =
had nuclear weapons around for a=20
long time. If it comes to pass, then what will you do?=20

I see no problem with being concerned about the future, maybe it becomes a =
good thought question.=20

What can anyone do about it? Meaning that the interaction of humans may hav=

John's purpose is simple, maybe it is complex. Still from leaders in the wo=

Here's and example:=20

General Ivashov: Russia insists on preservation of 1972 ABM Treaty=20


295=20



12.03.01. 18:29=20

Russia's position on the 1972 Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Mi=
ssile Systems is unchanged: it=20
is necessary to preserve the Treaty, strictly observe its standards, and pe=
rform all obligations the sides=20
took upon themselves. Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, chief of the Main Dir=
ectorate of International=20
Military Cooperation at the Defense Ministry of Russia, was reported as mak=
ing an official statement at a=20
press conference in Moscow March 12.=20

He also stressed that "Russia regarded and regards NATO's progress east as =
a threat to its security and the=20
Russian position in this matter has suffered no changes either."=20

In his opinion, the Russian proposals on the creation of a European non-str=
ategic antimissile defense=20
system, which were handed to NATO Secretary General George Robertson in the=
 course of his February visit=20
to Moscow, "are diametrically opposite to the U.S. intentions of creating a=
 national missile defense=20
system."=20

The Russian proposals "are not leading to breaches of some obligations or o=
ther treaties in this sphere,"=20
he explained. The U.S. intentions at the same time are leading to the disru=
ption of the 1972 ABM Treaty,=20
he said.=20

Russia's proposals are based on the idea of creating "international mobile =
forces for relocation to=20
directions of missile threat, whereas the U.S.A. intends to cover only its =
national territory with a=20
protective umbrella," he said.=20

In this connection, in his view, the Russian proposals, as opposed to the U=
.S. ones, "will not cause an=20
arms race but rather may reverse it."=20

Creating an U.S. national missile defense system, on the contrary, "will le=
ad to a competitive process=20
between creators of strategic defense and attack systems," he claimed.=20

In accordance with his statement, Russia will never agree to having the Uni=
ted States unilaterally disrupt=20
the foundation of international security such as the ABM Treaty is.=20

Russia's proposals on the creation of a European non-strategic antimissile =
system are "diametrically=20
opposite" to the U.S. plans to create a national missile defense system, he=
 said.=20

"Our proposals do not breach any agreements and will not lead to an arms ra=
ce whereas the U.S. program will=20
assist a competitive process in the area of strategic defense and attack sy=
stems," he stressed.=20

He also mentioned the fact that in the UN Security Council 89 countries spo=
ke against the U.S. national=20
missile defense system and only four in support of it. "The majority of cou=
ntries are on our side and this=20
frightens the U.S.A.," he concluded.=20

He also said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and U.S. State Secretary =
Colin Powell would soon discuss=20
the U.S. plans and the Russian proposals in this area.=20

"For our part, we will try to convince the U.S.A. that the implementation o=
f their plans will have ruinous=20
consequences for the world community," he said.=20

(It just seems right when a talk show host around where I live still says t=
hat Russia still has people that=20
react the old way, (as a Communist) when discussing anything about these tr=
eaties.) As of 3/12/01, this=20

At one time I asked you about the mass of your singularities but didn't rec=
eive an answer. From other=20
information gathered here it appears that your machine heats to about 100 d=
egrees (approx. 400 kelvin).=20

The Hawking Radiation of a singularity with a mass of 3 x 10 A 20 kg of mas=
s would have a temperature of=20
approx. 400 kelvin.=20

Hawking radiation in kelvins=3D(6 x 10 A -8/M) where M is Solar masses. The=
 smaller the mass the greater the=20
temperature.=20

The mass of 3 x 10 A 20 kg is equilalent to a slice of the Earth 1.2 miles =
wide at the equator, extending=20
from pole to pole to the depth of the center of the Earth. (The mass of the=
 Earth is 5.98 x 10 A 24 kg.)=20

Your society isn't involved in space travel (according to earlier posts) so=
 it appears that your=20
singularities are madfe from the Earth itself. Ouch! Your society is killin=
g the world. Eco-terrorists as=20
it were.=20

Where is the mass coming from?=20

E=3DMCsquared can be solved for mass too.=20

EMMETT :=20

This appeared to be the same question from the other site so I just copied =
my old response.=20

((For instance, he has stated that his society is not involved in space tra=
vel. He's also stated that the=20
temperature in and around his device while in use is approximately 100 degr=
ees (approx 375 kelvin). ))=20

I'm not sure I understand the connection between no space travel and the te=
mperature around the device.=20

( (If the Hawking Radiation of a black hole stated in Kelvins is...) )=20

The singularities are not unstable; therefore, uncontrolled evaporation is =
not possible. In addition, there=20
is no extemporaneous matter near the singularity that would cause it to giv=
e off radiation or heat.=20

((Or - he's taken a slice of the Earth about 1.2 miles wide at the equator =
from pole to pole down to the=20
center of the Earth and compressed it into a singularity. And his machine h=
as two of them, GE has a larger=20
unit (C206) and there are multiple machines of each model (C204 &amp; C206)=
. ))=20

A singularity about the size of an electron would only require the mass of =
a large mountain. The=20
singularities inside the C204 are much small than that. And no, I didn't ma=
ke them.=20

((If his society doesn't space travel - then they are gobbling up the Earth=
 to make their singularities.))=20
You know... E =3D MC squared can be written to solve for mass too.=20

John Titor, would you consider having your departure from this time period =

What would you expect to be seen during that event from the outside perspec=

He is planning on having someone video tape his departure.=20

I know that you don't understand...which is sad. Its the Hawking Radiation =
that you can't overcome. This=20
radiation is seperate from any other radiation given off by extemporaneous =
matter falling into the=20
singularity. It is part of the description of a singularity per se absent a=
ny other matter. A singularity=20
emits Hawking Radiation.=20

A simple "E=3DMc A 2" isn't the answer here. You have to form the singulari=
ty for your machine to work and that=20
takes mass - real, not virtual mass. You have to get the mass for the singu=
larity from somewhere and if=20
you can't or don't travel in space (to grab the mass from somewhere other t=
han Earth) then you have to be=20
gobbling up the planet itself.=20

The truly faulty part of your description of your device involves the Hawki=
ng Radiation. You can't overcome=20
it and you can't ignore it. Its not the size of the singularity that matter=
s - its solely the mass=20
involved that determines the temperature of the radiation.=20

400 kelvin or 100 degrees C emitted as Hawking Radiation from the singulari=
ty requires a mass of 3 * 10 A 20=20
kg. Lert's assume that the mass of the singularity is "about the mass of a =
large mountain". Let's say that=20
the mass of the singularity is 1/1,000,000th (5.98*10 A 18 kg)the mass of t=
he Earth. The Hawking Radiation=20
temperature around your singularity will be approximately 20,000 degrees ke=
lvin. The surface temperature=20
of the sun is about 5,600 degrees kelvin. That's a sunburn that you won't f=
orget for a while.=20

So, the reparte has been fun. But your device, as described, simply won't w=
ork.=20

Its too bad that this has occurred. People want to believe in the future an=
d future technology but get=20
confused by bad science. As I've said before, it doesn't particularly bothe=
r me that you don't really have=20
a time machine. Its fun to " jus' 'spose" it was true. The problem comes wh=
en people really are convinced=20
that its true based on bad science. In any case, there's plenty of evidence=

mass - real, not virtual mass.))=20

That is incorrect.=20

((The truly faulty part of your description of your device involves the Haw=
king Radiation. You can't=20

However, and as I'm sure you are aware, Stephen Hawking admits that his own=
 equations support the=20

"possibility" that microsingularities may not totally disappear as they eva=

is being searched for specifically? I can assume weapons, but that seems to=

Also, John, can you elaborate on recognizing who the enemy will be domestic=

Hi John,=20

You've mentioned (and it makes sense that) computers get much better by you=
r time. Considering the vast=20
difference between that 1975-vintage IBM 5100 you've picked up and the comp=
uter I have sitting on my desk,=20
I can't imagine what computers will be like in 2036. Are they even still ca=
lled "computers"? Are you=20
carrying a computing device from your time? Have you had to use our ancient=
 technology for all this=20
posting? I think I'd like to use my 1978 TRS-80 Model 1 again for nostalgia=
's sake, but 10 minutes of that=20
and I'd have to stop from frustration. How are you coping with our "stone-k=
nives and bear-skins"=20
technology? That's a Star Trek reference. Have you watched Star Trek?=20

What can you tell us about future computing technology without conflicting =
with your "temporal prime=20
directive"? We could guess some things based on Moore's Law concerning stor=
age, speed, etc. It would be=20
nice for computer-geeks like me to hear some specifics though - especially =
about form, function and=20

John, you never addressed my question posted several days ago. Would you ad=
dress it?=20

Also, I noticed a post from you on a different thread where you said someth=
ing to the effect that=20

everything that can or could have ever happened has happened, and thus ther=
e's an infinite number of=20
realities.=20

If there were an infinite number of realities, then there would necessarily=
 arise a reality that somehow=20
causes there to be no other realities. In fact, an infinite number of such =
realities would have to arise=20
that cause there to be no other realities.=20

It'd also necessarily give rise to a reality that somehow causes there to b=
e only one single reality. In=20
fact, it would necessarily give rise to an infinite number of such realitie=
s that somehow cause there to=20
be only one reality.=20

It'd also necessarily give rise to a reality that somehow causes there to n=
o realities at all. In fact, it=20
would necessarily give rise to an infinite number of such realities that so=
mehow cause there to be no=20
realities at all.=20

One might desire to argue that such realities could arise in the future, fr=
om our perspective, and we=20

simply haven't encountered the effects of that yet but we might in our futu=
re. But if that where the case,=20
then there would necessarily arise an infinite number of realities that som=
ehow causes there to have never=20
been any other reality from any perspective.=20

Etc.=20

There seems to be a bit of a problem with any sort of "infinite reality" co=
ncept (or infinite Universes,=20
for that matter), doesn't there?=20

So furthermore, if there's a limit to the quantity of realities (or Univers=
es, for that matter), which=20
logic clearly dictates that there must be, what is the limiting factor?=20

Is it the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin? I don't thi=

a turn for the worst. See... we the people, ARE the government. When a soci=

The problem with this is - people like me still exist and probably always w=

We watch foreign governments and wonder what they will do next, even predic=

things like Mad Cow disease - and more recently a suddenl virile outbreak o=

didn't hit just one farm, it hit most of England at the same time. I believ=

this was a biological attack (what better way to get away with murdering mi=

getting caught? You reduce their food supplies, and they die slowly. You're=
 never caught because no one=20

Sitting here, reading this forum - and seeing what someone else saw - that =

If John has been accurate on even a small portion of his future predictions=
 (which by the way, he has made=20

MEL: I think what John actually said was that typewriters are in use in the=

note that will be simply thrown away after it is read....hmmm=20

As for the "Pie Pipper", I am not sure what is meant except perhaps it is r=

=20

RICK: I identify closely with all you stated above.=20

"I keep my hands in intelligence - though no longer professionally. Once yo=
u're a part of that, you never=20
really leave it."=20

I believe that. I have done skip tracing for an attorney and am glad I deve=
loped those skills. Helps me now=20
in searching for truth and reality. I knew a fella who claimed to be retire=
d CIA. One night we had a=20
couple drinks..well I did, he had more than a few. Anyway, he proceded to t=
ell me a lot of really intense=20
stuff and some less intense but still interesting as far as discussion. Abo=
ut a year later some things he=20
talked about were coming to light in media and the net....he had been retir=
ed for several years. What was=20
really sad in his case was that he was obviously an intelligent man, but he=
 was so burnt out mentally and=20
physically, and very aggressive.=20

"At the same time - I believe, apparently like John, that our society, and =

I agree with that statement as well, but I see a further influence in this.=
 Media attempts to entertain=20

I've felt this for about 5-6 years now. I can not put my finger on it,"=20

For a long time I have interpreted a feeling that I am supposed to DO somet=

eventualities), but as of yet do not know what for sure. I too sense a shif=

"We see things like Mad Cow disease"=20

I like the way the thread is going here.=20

I brought up the patent/copyright ideas because time travel does pose some =

However it could still impact the present GE. It's an interesting area to e=

How do the two Boards of Directors protect their company(s) and their share=
holders? For the doubters,=20

material.=20

What, if any, standing does a potential plaintiff have and how do they asse=

John, I still have my doubts about your machine based on the science - but =
there's always the chance that=20
I'm wrong. So, I'm not changing-up on you but posing some questions for you=

If we view the two worldlines as separate nations that have contact with ea=

BTW - Government documents actually can be and are copyrighted. Here's one =

DARBY: Indeed it is interesting you bring up the possible problems of the R=

GE is in direct competition (in=20
some areas)with the other companies you list, I cannot recall a single proj=
ect that was soley developed by=20
a single contractor in recent time. Even various projects for NASA are Boei=

For Example: The B2 Bomber is a Northrop creation, they are Prime contracto=

anies as suppliers to these=20
larger systems.=20

Besides, being that this is a separate world line from John's, the point is=
 moot. At worst the development=20

I am the boss of myself here, if anything, then the other mes in other worl=

towards a coherent whole before most of the mes 'goodly-mes' die, leaving t=

morally bad worldlines to not have any choice in the say of it ( and they s=

this is about as much sense as this multiple world-lines multiple realities=

I have acheived my objective,=20
understanding that the me in this world-line is still not sure that all thi=

Conclusion of the "Perfect Symmetry of All".=20

As an example:=20

In Einstein's Equation there are four possible 'states' of reality.=20

These four would be:=20

+E =3D +(MC A 2)=20

-E =3D +(MC A 2)=20

+E =3D -(MC A 2)=20

-E =3D -(MC A 2)=20

The two middle results are of an imaginery numbering system.=20

The signs are not minus, but negative.=20

The two middle equations cancel out, forming a "nonexistence". The other tw=
o equations form "existence".=20

E =3D MC A 2=20

-E =3D -(MC A 2) .=20

Both exist.=20

Now we must venture in to the imaginery worlds of existence.=20

I leave you to your own thoughts.=20

As Einstein stated "God does not play dice with the Universe".=20

To do other, may lead to irrational and implausible 'states' for existence,=
 that can not ever be as been=20

It is all contained in the Chocolate Sandwich Cremes filled cookies or in a=

This leaves anyone to deal with the anti-dimensions. We all conclude that d=
ealing with anti-dimensions may=20
be a waste of time, for we break down the "set" of mathematics (existence) =
to suit our own purposals.=20

nti infinite world-lines where=20

 the two imaginary existence=20
that does no good or evil to prove.=20

Therefore, there are more "All of yous" in existence, that can be proved ma=

Away the political-legal palaver and back to science for a bit...=20

A few of our posts back in reply to my comment, "A simple E=3DMc A 2 is not=
 the answer...you need real, not=20
virtual mass" to form the singularity" you said "Not True" or close thereto=
.=20

You're still missing it, John, as we talk about singularities. Hawking Radi=
ation and General Relativity.=20

The universe that you described, that is, one where mass is accelerated to =
light speed and forms a=20
singularity doesn't exist. If that were so you have some really bad problem=
s:=20

1. As you accelerated to light speed in your machine you and your machine f=
ormed a black hole=20

2. From your perspective as you accelerated to light speed every other obje=
ct in the universe formed a=20
black hole due to your relative velocities=20

Of course neither event occurred. The problem is the comic book view of Gen=
eral Relativity and the=20
definition of mass in E=3DMc A 2.=20

The word "mass" has two distinct and very different definitions:=20

Mr =3D relativistic mass=20

Mo =3D invariant mass (rest mass)=20

Invariant mass is independent of v velocity.=20

You are stating your singularity forms as a result of Mr =3D E/c A 2...The =
formula is correct. The statement is=20
not.=20

The definition of rest mass is Mo =3D sqrt (E A 2/c A 4 - p A 2/c A 2)=20

p=3Dmomentum! Momentum...motion...kinetic energy! Its not there in E=3DMc A=
 2.=20

The comic book view that General Relativity somehow suggests that a if a bo=
dy is accelerated to light speed=20
that it will form a singularity is based on the formula "2GM/c A 2". That i=
s, if the body is squeezed small=20
enough by acceleration its radius will be smaller than the Schwarzschild ra=
dius surrounding it...it falls=20
inside of the event horizon. This comes from very early interpretations of =
General relativity which=20
ignored momentum and angular momentum...it was a static solution. Einstein =
himself stated that it applied to=20
kinetic energy - not rest mass. There are many places where this can be ver=
ified. American Journal of=20

John was born sometime between 1954 and 1956. He attended a west coast univ=

 His major was either cultural=20
anthropology or general sociology. He may have dropped out in his senior ye=
ar but his expected year of=20
graduation was between 1975 and 1977. He took, as an elective, cosmology, i=
ntroduction to astronomy or=20
both. He did not take any upper division physical science. Neither of his p=
arents graduated from a=20
university but managed to provide a very stable life for him.=20

His understanding of physics is based on 1970's emerging physics but he did=
n't keep abreast of the advances=20
in the field until about six months ago. His new knowledge since that time =
is based on cursory internet=20
searches so that he can respond to inquiries. He is very intelligent and a =

The use of the language isn't something you can practice so that you can ch=
ange it. The linguistic synapses=20
were formed by the time you were three years of age - by age 12 they were f=
ully developed (which is why=20
aphasic children over the age of 11 or 12 rarely learn to talk). Much like =
a polygraph, the analysis would=20
reveal the forced use of the language via inconsistencies. There is no such=
 anamoly in your syntax,=20
frequency, idiomatic usage, etc. Northern California baby-boomer American S=

The answer to the question, "How does a person born in 1998 use the languag=
e...?" is - who knows? Those=20
persons are three years old today and just learning to speak. What we do kn=
ow, however, is that during the=20
course of their life they will learn how to talk by age 12...and the common=
 usage of the language will be=20
statistically different than what we use today.=20

Everyone knows this instinctively. We can listen to a movie made in the 196=
0's, for instance, and there is=20
no doubt that we are listening to a movie made in the 60's based on the dia=
logue. We also have a pretty=20

Although I can appreciate the study of language and the determination of lo=
cality based on that, I would=20
suspect that IF John is from the future, language pattern would have change=
d and in some ways not=20
progressed too much insofar as patterns. John painted a picture of a world =
in distress for many years, and=20
indeed our US. Looking back in my studies to WW2, there were many things th=
at changed and progressed, but=20
what did not change was language.except slang terms.=20

I have not noticed too many slang terms from John, but I have noticed some =
(real or not) difficultly with=20
certain phrasing. I refer you back to earlier in the thread when questions =
arose from phrases involving=20
'sell out' type of things. I am not an expert on language, but aspire to be=
 so I am not saying I am=20
correct. I am just guessing that if John is from the future, and less focus=
 is applied to money and greed,=20
as he implied, phrases implying the selling and buying of goods as slang, w=
ould be confusing. That remains=20
consistent.=20

I am all for being skeptical, but approaching the language factor is not, t=
o me, proof John is from our=20
time. Conversely, it does not imply he is from the future either. His story=
 actually supports the idea he=20
is from the future when subtleties such as what I mention are look at. Go f=
igure, we are still at the=20
point of maybe-maybe not.=20

Interesting this "language" thing Darby came up with. I'm certain he is cor=
rect in his assessment of=20
listening to a movie made in the 1960s, or '50s. I know that I can personal=
ly tell you from the dialect of=20
a movie without having seen the video running approximately which year the =
movie was made. Of course,=20
there is a degree of inaccuracy in doing so.=20

As far as dialect changes go, I'm sure that from decade to decade there are=
 obvious changes and some not so=20
obvious changes. There are terms I remember from when I was a kid that are =
used even now. There are things=20
I've seen in movies made before I was born, that also are in use, even now.=
=20

I do not see that this placing someone based on their language is an exact =
science.=20

John/Pamela - Pictures. I have plenty of web space, and I expect the site t=
o remain online (though is has=20
gone down on and off over the past couple of years due to weird problems). =
My web site=20

http://survival.anomalies.net and another site I assist in managing http://=
www.anomalies.net are both=20
available for the video, as well as the pictures. I have the pictures alrea=
dy and will try to get them up=20
on my site tonight - under the heading of "Time Travel".=20

If and when there is a video made available - I would be happy to convert t=
hat into a format (or several=20
formats) for the computer and place it online for download. I would be more=
 than willing to come film it=20
independently myself - if John wishes (besides which, I would love to be th=
ere to see it for myself - if=20
only to know for myself that it is real).=20

So - John, you're welcome to contact me privately and I will personally arr=
ange my own travel, and bring my=20
cameras and video the whole thing - with complete confidence that I will no=
t reveal location, time, date=20
or anything else until after your departure.=20

About Albert Cattior... I'm wondering if Albert himself isn't a time travel=
er as well., and is suffering some=20
sort of time dysphasia or something. &lt;chuckles&gt;=20

Speaking of that - John, if you have time before you go., are there any kno=
wn mental disorders that are=20
associated with time travel?=20

Lastly: Someone mentioned (Sorry, can't remember who now, or where I read i=
t, but it was this forum)=20

something about "shelters won't be needed". If I understood the gist of thi=
s statement, it was meant in=20
the terms that if a nuclear attack becomes a reality, a shelter will be use=
less.=20

That can not be further from the truth. I can tell you I am accutely aware =
of what atomic/thermonuclear=20
weapons are capable of doing - and what they are NOT capable of doing. I al=
so know that depending on the=20
attack and the type of weapon, not only is an attack survivable, placing yo=
urself and your loved ones, as=20
well as a few weeks worth of food in a fallout shelter will protect you fro=
m fallout radiation.=20

My web site has survival information on it regarding such things, and belie=
ve it or not, it comes from the=20
US Government. So, even they believe nuclear strikes are survivalable. They=
 just do not press that=20
publicly, because 1) they do not want to panic people (because if the gover=
nment says you should have a=20
shelter, conspiracy theorists suddenly become convinced the government is t=
rying to warn us without=20
warning us, it upsets natives of other nuclear powers into believing WE wil=
l start a war - etc). 2) Doing=20
so legitimizes the use of nuclear weapons to everyone, thus making it more =
of a possibility they will be=20
used without a second thought to doing so. 3) It will raise the price of la=
nd throughout the United=20
States. Precived "safe zones" would go up in value - especially with pre-ex=
isting shelters. I'm sure there=20
are other reasons I haven't thought of, but suffice it to say that the gove=
rnment DOES believe nuclear war=20
is survivable. Just not by everyone.=20

I believe it as well. I'm not one of those guys that wants to be around for=
 the blast. With my luck I would=20
get blinded and blown around, but not killed outright, leaving me blinded a=
nd crippled and not able to=20
fend for myself, left to die miserably. I'd prefer a fighting chance. Give =
me a basement, some water and a=20
little food and I will make due. Don't count the human race off as defeated=
 the minute the nukes start=20
flying. We've been around a long time, and will continue to be around for m=
any more centuries.=20

The question is not, can or will the human race survive. The question is ho=
w WELL will they survive?=20

Question:=20

quote:Basically, tell us where you got your most recent profile for him =E2=

Answer:=20

quote:Its not related to "written phrenology". Its associated with linguist=
ics and statistical modelling of=20
the use of English words in this case. (And any detective work would defini=
tely not be amateur &lt;wink&gt;=20

Of course I am leaving out a lot, but I'd like to shine the hypothetical la=

So ... its not phrenology of the written word, and not amatueur detective w=

it is not imagination or non-amatueur detective work.=20

In fact, it is heralded as an off-shoot of modern linguistics and statistic=

If that is not at least simmular to textual-phrenology, I am misunderstandi=

Which is completely possible.=20

But it involves statistics, which I've always had a superstitious disbelief=
 in.=20

You have to be very carefull to qualify your results. Can you establish a o=
ne to one relationship between=20
certain subsets of attributes and certain subsets of people? Not absolutely=
. But you may be able to come=20
close enough to make your 90% probable guesses =E2=80=94 but the amount of =
work that would really take would be=20
staggering.=20

If you undertook it, then I salute you. But still respectfully choose to vi=
ew this as only one of many=20
possibilities here, with no special status.=20

The sample sizes involved (that I am aware of) are simply not large enough =
to lend the confidence levels=20
you are implying.=20

It would take the analysis and comparison of billions of words from million=
s of reasonably 'representative'=20
individuals, and then a relativily large number of words from the target.=
=20

At least thats my intuition, and I've yet to see proof or convincing eviden=

John simply hasn't written enough words here. Perhaps you've dug through hi=
s trash and anaylyzed his snail-=20
mail correspondence . . . making your sample size bigger, and more represen=
tative ... but would it be big=20

enough?=20

Way too many variables to play with here, even for the mythic strengths of =
'statistics'.=20

Language usage is mutable. Upbringing and other factors of environment have=
 effects. But so do conciouis=20
decisions while composing, the nature of the form of communication, the sub=
ject's emotional state at the=20
moment, the proximity of a thesaurus, etc..=20

At the moment, 'he' could be a accidental persona who is the results of tho=

on topic'-ness is then just a=20
weird coincedence.=20

That is just as likely as any of the profiles presented so far.=20

Explain why this isn't phrenology of the written word =E2=80=94 or diff. en=

I thought Darby's observations interesting. Since I read his post I have tu=

John is a White male of 38 years who may or may not be a time traveller. He=

By his own claim, he has more documentation, but chooses not to share it. T=
his makes sense to me, for if I=20
were a TT, I would not give out more than I chose to. In fact, here on the =
bbs, we each can simply give=20
just the details of what we want others to know. In subtle ways John has gi=
ven predictions and even 1 date=20
that I came across. This does not validate Johns status, but in the coming =
days to years we all shall see.=20

In a nutshell, methods such as linguistic phrenology may have some credit, =
but no evidence of how that=20

'science' was utilized in the 'john model' has been given. That leads itsel=
f to be just as known as Johns=20

I suggest that those with the gutteral umph to do it, go back. Read ALL of =
Johns statements. Put them=20
together. Analyze what was written. Not for Regional specificity, but for t=

scattered about. If not read carefully, one might miss things stated.=20

Bash me if you like, but I am at a point were I sincerely HOPE John is a TT=
. None of us can say yeah or nay=20

space on the web site, as well as digitizing the video - making it free for=

I do not believe that making a video "for profit" is going to convince anyo=

Worse, turning such a video over to anyone other than say. Art Bell himself=

The history John Titor, resemblances to me a April Fools' joke of the stude=
nts.=20

1) The style of thinking is similar to style of thinking of the American of=
 1990. And plot of a film-hit:=20

When all people of the Earth catch illness a "cow rage". Or such as - what =
will be, if there will be=20

overturning magnetic poles of the Earth?=20

2) The history of the people abounds "surprises". But we to them quickly ge=
t accustomed. In this history=20
there are no surprises. There is nothing is paradoxical new.=20

3) How to distinguish micro Kerr black holes from electron, proton or neutr=
on? The difference will be in=20
mass?=20

It microsingularites. How it to make macrosingularites? I think, it is nece=
ssary better to know thin=20
structure of a matter.=20

4) It is necessary to distinguish a "global line" from "worldline". There i=
s an analogy: many people go on=20
the rope bridge. The bridge is swing from a wind and movement of the people=
. The rope bridge is a "global=20
line" matters (body of the man). "Worldline" is a trajectory of movement of=
 the man in space on the rope=20
bridge. Obviously, a "Global line" from "worldline" are connected among the=
mselves, but they differ.=20

If I would be TTer, I would study properties of a "global line". I would st=
udy, how the change of events in=20
the past (events at my doubles in the past), my opportunity influences to c=
hange events in the present=20
time.=20

Certainly, it is difficult. But it is possible to begin from study of a sit=

One thing to note, which I can not remember if I mentioned before - and I a=
m sure no one else has at this=20
point, is a yellow object in the upper part of the picture of the machine i=
n the vehicle. The yellow=20
device is a geiger counter. I'm familiar with THAT machine specifically - n=
ot just gieger counters, but=20
THAT model. I've used it. I carried two of them in tactical weather gear in=
 the 1970's and 80's. I also=20
used one of those devices extensively during my stay at the White House fro=
m 1989-1992 during training at=20
a facility outside of DC, where we trained for NBC (nuclear/biological/chem=
ical) warfare. More=20
specifically I used them during training for "shelter management" where we =
each played President and=20
others.=20

Anyway, that is a real device. If you look carefully, you will see an older=
 "CD" or Civil Defense sticker=20
on the side. The device is rather old though - probably built in the mid to=
 late 70s and was an important=20
piece of gear in my weather systems and shelters I took care of in those da=
ys. It could have come from old=20
stocks of military gear (in 2013 or later) or it could have come from surpl=
us store in 1999 or 2000. Not=20
sure.=20

I did want to point out what it was though.=20

From the book "Galaxies" by Tim Ferris, yes I know its getting old, but the=
n, why is anyone who deals with=20
the structure of cosmology still are leaning this way:=20

One of a number of sophisticated cosmological models that have been constru=
cted within the broad purview of=20
the big-bing account of cosmic history, this theory, proposed by J. Richard=
 Gott III of Princeton=20
University, postulates the existence of not one universe but three. It envi=
sions that the big bang gave=20
rise not only to our universe, where matter predominates over antimatter an=
d time runs forward, but a=20
second universe where antimatter predominates and time moves backward, as w=
ell as a tachyon universe where=20
everthing moves faster than the velocity of light. Our universe and the ant=
imatter universe are segregated=20

in terms of time. Both are segregated from the tachyon universe in terms of=
 space, since the tachyons in=20

the first instant of creation fled beyond the light cones of all observers =
in both the matter and=20
antimatter universes.=20

The Gott cosmology is a masterpiece of symmetry without being dictatorial a=
bout it: it predicts, for=20

instance, that there should be traces of contamination of our universe by a=
ntimatter (as has been verified=20
by observation) and by tachyons (as has not). Whatever likelihood we might =
care to assign to its validity,=20

in this combination of symmetry and imperfection the Gott model is redolent=
 of nature's style.=20

Now are you sure that you can not communicate with another you in the antim=
atter universe?=20

Now what if this is proved. It may prove that God (she) has put you all ove=
r the place, and in many=20

different places for one reason, you may have the means to destroy yourself=
 with science of the future.=20

She(God) has wiped your butt all over the place already, now who won beside=

I am not sure I understood your piece there Albert. Are you saying that bec=
ause someone else films/video=20
tapes the departure, we might not see it on tape?=20

I'm not sure what that has to do with antimatter. If John were an anti-matt=
er John, he could not have come=20
here in the first place. One doesn't have to meet ones-self to destroy ones=
elf when made of antimatter.=20

One mere must contact ANY matter. Matter and antimatter will obliterate one=

is in when it contacts.=20

Darby: The two yellow caution tapes on the device are misaligned. Sloppy wo=

Which is pretty much normal for government equipment. Doesn't prove anythin=

is government gear that has similar lables. None of them are aligned.=20

As far as a "good call" well, I'm not sure about that, I was just stating w=
hat I know to be facts from=20
personal experience. I know, for instance that the yellow geiger counters w=
ere standard gear for fallout=20

I simply can not recall that part). I will never forget using them though. =
The government cost back then=20

Albert;=20

I see your point. But... it will prove it to ME. That's what *1* care about=
. Call me selfish if you like, but=20
I could care less if anyone else believes or not. I don't care if you do, o=
r Javier believes or=20
disbelieves.=20

I am trying to show 1) Either fraud or 2) John is a time traveler.=20

If someone goes and actually is present as a witness besides his own family=
 or personal friends, it won't=20
matter then because they can not fake the photography, nor pull "magic tric=
ks" - smoke and mirrors,=20
whatever you want to call it.=20

I consider myself qualified as an observer for several reasons.=20

First and foremost, I'm extremely interested in the outcome of this exercis=
e.=20

Secondly, I'm a skeptic. For a skeptic to see something with their own eyes=
, is PROOF POSITIVE to a=20
skeptic. Whether or not YOU believe the skeptic is up to you. If you went I=
 might believe you. If Javier=20
goes, I would definately believe him. Personally, I do not trust Javier to =
go without doing something to=20
disrupt things. He has made it very clear he has a problem - moral or other=
wise, with time travelers.=20

Thirdly, I'm a "trained observer". My jobs over the years, from engineer, t=
o teacher, to computer 'guru' to=20
storm chaser more than qualifies me to do the job of objectively observing =
an experiment and giving a=20
truthful and objective report on the subject, no matter what the subject en=
tails.=20

Fourthly, I've heard no one else offer their services, their own hard earne=
d cash or their time to do this.=20

I have. I certainly haven't seen Art Bell come in the forum and post his th=
oughts. If he had, and offered=20
to be there, and perhaps do a live report, that would have been the best th=
ing. I don't think he will -=20
for several reasons. But most importantly, it could be dangerous!=20

Fifthly - Danger... been there, done that. I'm afraid of heights and don't =
climb if I dont have to. I do have=20
antenna towers in the back and climb them. I have to. I hate and am afraid =
of flying. I've been to 42=20
countries. I didn't get there on a slow boat. I've been shot at many times =
in Central America, and also in=20
the middle east. Nancy Reagan and Richard Nixon have chewed my ass. I'm not=
 afraid of anything else=20
(except spiders). I do not have to fly (cept to get there), I don't have to=
 climb (cept perhaps to get a=20
good video shot), I don't have to deal with spiders, Nancy Reagan or Richar=
d Nixon. I DO have to get=20
truthful video, good pictures and even perhaps an interview if John would c=
onsent to doing so. This I CAN=20
DO.=20

Sixthly - I consider myself a decent writer. You will get a very good repor=
t.=20

Now... Whether you chose to believe the data that I will bring you, is up t=
o you - and each person will have=20
to decide. Without knowing me personally, none of you can be sure I'm not a=
 government agent, I'm not a=20
Russian Spy or I'm not in cahoots with John.=20

Since I'm not any of these things, and I don't have much else I can show yo=
u right now to prove this,=20
you'll have to take my word. For now.=20

However, anyone that wants to know more about me is welcome to read up on m=
y writing, my bio and a lot of=20
other stuff on my web site. You can - as several people have pointed out, g=
et a good idea of a person's=20

and no one will get that information from me under ANY circumstances, but t=

Here's what I think of John at this point.=20

It really does not matter if he is a TT or not, well, it might.=20

John thought about some things going on and with technology and he decided =
that he had something to say=20

about the future as he saw it. He came up with a story to get people intere=
sted with what he was thinking.=20
That was: time travel may be possible in the future, if it is, and other co=
untries found out, this may not=20
be good. He presented it as a story to strongly interest people about what =
they thought about the future,=20
if time travel becomes a reality.=20

He may have a three year old and wonder what kind of world he will grow up =
in.=20

I must admit that I was not really thinking in those terms, so to me it was=
 a wake up call. You get going=20

Here's something I found out this year. During the Cold War or maybe about =
in the '70's, the Russians were=20
working on a new type of jet engine. This engine that uses, if I remember r=
ight because its not at the=20
newscientist website anymore, ionized gases to control the engine. This mea=
ns that it needs no wings, no=20
airelons, or controls. Just by changing the ionized gas flowing around the =
engine, this engine is unique.=20
Now NASA been informed of it, and is working with it, and Russia can build =
a plane, not mach speed, but=20
for transport that uses this type of engine. It called something like "Plas=

consider the fact that this engine may be a prototype UFO, I guess it may a=

forerunner that could eventually be used to some effect as a UFO moves. Con=
sider that. Russians are not=20
dumb. At the BBC Talking Point, they had the question, just a few weeks ago=
 "Is Russia a Superpower?" Now=20
responses came from around the world, including Russians. One said that the=

Here's another thing, well, maybe not that important.=20

Harpoon IV is coming out about the end of this year or so.=20

The Navy people play this game. I have Harpoon II and you can download it f=
ree, I think still, at website=20
Home of the Underdogs, I think but not sure, its underdogs.com. Well, writt=
en by Larry Bond, a Naval=20
Officer of many years, it is about Naval Warfare. The database is well wort=

most part, the Navies of different nations, and type of weapons. Its the cl=
oses to having about the best=20
unclassified weapons of war of the modern age. The new one being programmed=
 by someone else will be more=20
of a 3-D type Harpoon. Russians weapons are usually twice the size of US we=
apons and if you get hit by=20
one, that's about it. The US weapons usually take 2 or 3 to sink one of the=
ir submarines or ships. In any=20
case, Russians have more subs than anything else right now, besides land wa=
rfare. The new Harpoon IV will=20
have landings of Marines on shore. I learned a great deal about weapon syst=
ems on this planet from that=20
computer game.=20

Just a thought.=20

That Russian engine is still a kind of jet engine. The only way it might fl=
y, (and I am just imagining),=20
around is put it so it swivels. Just dreaming at this point. Still more lik=
e a regular airplane. Ionized=20

Albert... what are you talking about? A "small weapon"? A "large weapon"? T=
here is no such thing as a "200=20
mile blast range". The fireball from the largest ever known thermonuclear w=
eapon was less than 5 miles in=20
diameter. The Russians are purported to have built a 350 megaton bomb at on=
e point, of course, we do not=20

Your numbers are way out of scale. I suggest you spend some time doing some=

This should get you started. You will not find anywhere in any of the data =
where there are 200 mile radii=20
damage zones. Even with the worst thing the Russians can throw at the Unite=
d States there might be a 7-10=20
mile damage radius around the blast zone.=20

In my reserch, 20 Megatons seems to be the absolute maximum any one weapon =
will do. Yeah, they are bad,=20
they are radioactive and they are gonna do some serious, serious damage to =
the land and perhaps even the=20
planet. However, 200 bombs will not "obliterate" the United States.=20

Rick,=20

If you have contact with Boomer please attempt to verify the elapsed time (=
on his internal chronometer) for=20
his trip from 2036 to 1975. I need that data for a calculation.=20

Two problems still unresolved:=20

Problem #1=20

Early on Boomer posted that the radius of effect of the time distortion fie=
ld is 12 to 15 feet=20

(Schwarzschild Radius of 4 to 5 meters). He also said that the mass of the =
singularities is that of a=20
"small mountain". I suggested 3*10 A 18/kg (1/2,000,000th the mass of the E=
arth)and he did not dispute it=20
(though it may be smaller)...=20

anyone see where I'm going with this?=20

Problem #2=20

There's another problem with his diagrams on your site:=20

Page #5 (C204 Tipler Sinusoid...) Item #1 shows the twin singularities in l=
ine with the x-ray venting zone.=20

The schematic following the photos also shows the singularities in line - a=
nd in line with the driver's=20
seat. It seems that the x-rays are vented directly at the driver.=20

I'll post the answer to problem #1 later. Just giving everyone else a chanc=
e to do the math.=20

Hint: R=3D2GM/c A 2 (I posted this formula with little comment for Boomer l=
ast week. He didn't pick up on its=20
significance.)=20

Rick,=20

I do hope that you get a chance to see Boomer off. But a video won't help p=
rove the veracity of Boomer's=20
story. If what he says is true you'll only have a video fogged by x-ray emm=
issions (and maybe some=20
leukemia for yourself). If its unfogged then everything given to you to pos=
t on your site about the device=20
is false and misleading.=20

The last time I checked the physics I didn't see an "on-off" switch for a b=
lack hole or any other=20

singularity. Whether his machine is on or off the singularities continue to=
 generate an event horizon. The=20
singularities are contained in the black box. I have a very good idea of wh=
at the Schwarzchild Radius of=20
the alleged micro-singularities should be. The black box lies within the ev=
ent horizon. How does one=20
photograph an object inside the event horizon from the exterior of the even=
t horizon (in this case the=20
driver's window of a Chevy pick-up)?=20

If there is an x-ray problem associated with his machine how is it that his=
 photos aren't fogged? And,=20
though he's never said that he hasn't let anyone else come close to the mac=
hine, who took the picture of=20
his two hands in one of the photos?=20

Posted by Javier Cortez on 03-22-2001 12:47 AM=20

In my opinion, I don't believe John, A.k.a "Boomer" expected people to not =
believe him this close to his=20
leave date of April 10th (his window of opportunity). I'm sure he wanted ev=
eryone to believe his story.=20

But in-light to what Darby has shown us, and John's unwillingness to rebutt=
al. We must now see that he has=20
forfeited his opportunity to prove us wrong (your silence only incriminates=
 you and confirms that you are=20
a fraud). Cause he him self is wrong. Somehow, I think Darby was an unexpec=
ted variable. I'm glad you were=20
apart of this discussion; I take my hat off to you Darby , great job.=20

Just something to think about... I know that some of John's loyal subjects =
will continue to think he was for=20
real. But I have never, nor have I ever wished that he were a real Time Tra=
veler. The rest of you, shame-=20
shame. Always answering questions for him, defending him, giving him a way =
out, never really letting him=20
do it all on his own. Always sounded like Heaven's Gate to me.=20

Until then, I think John has sung his last song. Either that, or he's cramm=
ing as much math, physics and=20
logic to assist him in answering the last questions. Last chance to make pe=
ople believers aye John?=20

I expect a good answer John, if you do decide to answer . If not, that was =
pretty rude of you to leave=20
without saying good-bye. Or what kind of idiots do you take us for making a=
n excuse like that .=20

Javier,=20

What surprises me about the believers is that they apparently never really =
looked closely at what Boomer=20
was telling them. Now, I don't think he's a bad guy - I've enjoyed the time=
 (there's that word again)=20
we've spent together bantering this subject - but...=20

Here's who Boomer says he is (from the totality of his posts but more speci=
fically his early posts):=20

A civil war begins in the U.S. when he's six years old (2004). By 2012, at =
age 14, he's a member of a=20

Florida vanguard revolutionary brigade fighting the "enemy state". He and h=
is military assist the former=20

Soviet Union (Russia) with their invasion of the United States. He said, "T=
he enemy attacked by Russia was=20
the forces of the government you are under now." He said that the conflict =
"will consume everyone in the=20
U.S. by 2012". This will be followed by a short WWIII in 2015.=20

Surely some of the gentle readers have children. Lola has two teenagers. Wh=
o else has children, spouses,=20
loved ones who will be of military service age between 2004 and 2012? Boome=
r admits to making war on the=20
United States and giving aid and comfort to the invading enemy forces. Soun=
ds like treason from our=20
perspective. Sounds like murder if its your children that he kills in the c=
onflict. As Rick Donaldson=20

would say, we are the government - we the people. Boomer says that we are t=
he enemy.=20

So - for the supporters: do you really hope that he's what he says that he =
is? Is this what you want for=20
your children?=20

Rick, I check it out later.=20

To me, after seeing movies of H-bombs, early pictures, I was under the impr=
ession that a shock-wave is what=20
goes that far or so. Pictures I seen of old '50's type mushroom clouds had =
trees down and everything=20

flated by the shockwave of the blast. That's what I'm going by.=20

I look it up later, I have to catch up on things I have to get done.=20

I been just thinking, like Emmett perhaps, doesn't anyone see anything wron=
g with building, how can I put=20

it?=20

I think John said essentially, although I may have to review:=20

An electron fed, spin controlled, (for the ergospheres), rotating microsing=
ularity.=20

At one point, because I was reading some posts of John, he said that contro=
lling the spin of (what I=20
thought)the microsingularity was what kept the ergospheres in line. Control=
ling both 'spins' of the=20
microsingularities.=20

How would you ever control the spin of a subatomic particle?=20

All we do is blast them in the accelerators to photograph the tracks made, =
because you can not even see the=20
particles, only the tracks that were left by the particles.=20

I have seen pictures, and if it were not for the track's photograph, there =
would be no picture of the=20
particle. The particle had already decayed, or something, that only left th=
e tracks to be photographed.=20
That's all anyone can get from blasting particles near the speed of light. =
They were black and white=20
photographs that only showed the tracks of the particle. Someday, I have to=
 look up those photographs,=20
maybe they have them at a particle accelerator website.=20

No, I was not on the Internet then, this was way back when I was in my loca=
l astronomy club. Over 11 years=20
ago. I remember those photos. I think it was Wayne the founder of the club =
who brought us those=20
photographs. Just a sorta long white-looking track where the particle had g=
one after smashing. Yes, if you=20
saw them, . spiraling off after impact.=20

Here's John's post (part of it, don't ask me what page):=20

The singularities do not create Tipler cylinders they create the same physi=
cal environment without all the=20
mass. The same math works for both. There are two singularities. Their mass=
 and spin is altered in order=20
to adjust the size of the ergosphere and cause the event horizons to intera=
ct and create the gravity=20
sinusoid. I have a basic home schooling education (k-12) and a bachelor's d=
egree in history.=20

I would like to know when humans can control the mass and spin of a singula=
rity?=20

Posted by Rick Donaldson on 03-22-2001 07:30 AM=20

Javier - You kill me. Haha. Basic training? You're 21 years old and have be=
en through basic? But you're not=20
in the military? What happened there? Typically, there is a minimum of thre=
e years of service required=20
after basic training. Get kicked out for your attitude? &lt;chuckles&gt;=20

Darby: Problem #1=20

Early on Boomer posted that the radius of effect of the time distortion fie=
ld is 12 to 15 feet=20
(Schwarzschild Radius of 4=20

to 5 meters). He also said that the mass of the singularities is that of a =
"small mountain". I suggested=20
3*10 A 18/kg=20

(1/2, 000, 000th the mass of the Earth) and he did not dispute it (though i=
t may be smaller)...=20

anyone see where I'm going with this?=20

I see where you're going - weight of the machine among other things. Also -=
 I do not believe that this is=20
the schwarzschild radius that he is talking about. That radius is the "blue=
 event horizon" - and... I hate=20
to say this, but nothing within that radius would be seen again. So... this=
 is more like the theory behind=20
tipler cylinders (read up on that, I'm not gonna explain it here). Basicall=
y though, you do NOT enter into=20
the radius when traveling along a tipler cylinder.=20

Problem #2=20

There's another problem with his diagrams on your site:=20

Page #5 (C204 Tipler Sinusoid...) Item #1 shows the twin singularities in l=
ine with the x-ray venting zone.=20

The schematic following the photos also shows the singularities in line - a=
nd in line with the driver's=20
seat. It seems that=20

the x-rays are vented directly at the driver.=20

Where's the problem? Hehehe. But, you have to note, that the diagram is NOT=
 TO SCALE. Also, remember that=20
no matter what government document you're talking about, if it is a manual,=
 it is GOING TO CONTAIN=20
INACCURACIES. The government uses "lowest bid" - remember?=20

About the "fogging of the film"... well, yes true, if it is film. Video tap=
e is magnetic. X-rays will not=20
affect magnetic tape in this manner - that is by fogging the video. There m=
ight be some "magenetic=20
domains" knocked out of place by x-radiation, however, the result would be =
these little sparkles you see=20
on the TV when you do not have a very good (strong) signal coming in. We ca=
ll it "snow". I'm sure folks=20
have seen this before.=20

I haven't really done any calculations on the distance of the event horizon=
 from the actual "surface" of a=20
black hole - but, I know what I've read states that the event horizon is ac=
tually very close to the=20
"surface" (if indeed it could be called a surface). Point being, we're talk=
ing about a 'microsingularity'.=20
I have my doubts as to whether it can exist inthe first place, but a physci=
st friend tells me that it is=20
possible for such a thing and indeed, there have been discussions of doing =
JUST that with a linear=20
accelerator. The problem was that they just weren't sure if it would decay =
quickly or become something=20
that might envelop the earth. There was no discussion of the "weight" of su=
ch a thing, because it is man=20
made, and would not be a true singularity.=20

I won't dispute any calculations you have made regarding the Schwarzchild R=
adius of the microsingularity,=20
but I will say, I believe it to be on the order of microns rather than inch=
es or feet. Remember, we're=20
talking about something the size of an electron.=20

By the way, *1* can tell electrons which way to spin and I'm not a "full fl=
edged physcist". So I suppose it=20
wouldn't be that big of a stretch to force a black hole to spin this way or=
 that.=20


330=20




Albert: I probably misunderstood your post. Yes, the blast radius is pretty=
 big, but it isn't 200 miles in=20
any case. Remember a blast wave is basically a supersonic sound wave and it=
 will dissapate over distance.=20
That dissapation is based on several factors, like density of the air, temp=
erature, how close to the=20
ground, etc etc. I'm sure I left something out. In any case, a blast wave w=
ill be very strong very close=20
to ground zero (the point of the ground above which the bomb is detonated).=
 As the wave travels outward,=20
and the distance increases, the overpressure drops quickly. I believe it is=
 an inverse of the distance=20
traveled. That basically means - as an example (and I'm not sure this is co=
mpletely accurate, but those=20
links I gave will tell you for sure) as the distance doubles the overpressu=
re will be reduced by a factor=20
of four. (It's too early for me to do math, and I was called into work last=
 night, so I'm doubly tired=20
now) .=20

Damage from a nuclear bomb would be devastating, but only in the target are=
a. That means... perhaps at=20
distances of up to 10 miles away there would be damage, increasingly worse =
as you get closer and closer to=20
ground Zero. But - as you get further and further away the damage is reduce=
d. Basically.. I have a ranch=20
style house -I'm seven miles from Cheynne mountain. If they hit it with a 2=
0 megaton bomb, my house goes=20
bye bye. My basement, however, will remain intact. It is below ground level=
 and unless the fire ball=20
touches the region below ground, then below ground is safe, that's been my =
point all along. Hence,=20
survivablity of nuclear attacks.=20

Your black and white photos of tracks of particle trails was accomplished a=
ctually, very easily. I've=20
performed those precise experiments without the aid of an accelerator mysel=
f. The tracks actually are=20
drawn in a cloud of vapor - usually C02 vapor. In fact when I did it, I use=
d radium from a old wrist=20
watch, and dry ice for the vapor. The trails were CLEARLY visible with the =
naked eye. When examined under=20
a magnifying glass (I used a microscope) I could seen the decay as a long t=
rail that fell into a "death=20
spiral" as I called it. When the particles decayed completely, the spiral e=
nded. Of course this occured=20
VERY fast, and essentially, I saw only the result of the decay, which was t=
he track in the fog.=20

I did these experiments when I was 15 years old or so, in my basement lab. =
I had a fully stocked=20
chemistry/physics lab when I was a kid. That stopped the day I ****ed near =
killed everyone in the house=20
with clorine gas... duh... Anyway, I decided that chemistry wasn't my bag, =
and went instead into electronics=20
and physics after that.=20

technology. You know this, but my point is that you appear to be going abou=
t distributing your beleif in a=20
counter-productive way.=20

Your current method of discussion seems clouded by your passionate dislike =
for the technology and frankly,=20
it is hard to take you serious because of that. At your web site you descri=

interesting read, but it is also not in the same form of presentation as yo=

PLEASE - There is NOTHING to dechiper. What I intended was a sort of "panic=

in these forums (and this is not the first, nor will it be the last) people=
 get the feeling they are being=20
stalked by the government, or some Men in Black or something. I can't say t=

tell you from PERSONAL EXPERIENCE that if someone suspects you of some nati=
onal security violation, they=20
are NOT going to contact you via email.=20

They ARE going to find out what you're about, and might even contact you in=
 person, but they will be=20

legitimate law enforcement officers, not men in black, not guys in green or=
 any other Three-Letter-Agency=20
EXCEPT the FBI.=20

See the FBI is the US Law Enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over nat=
ional security matters within=20
the United States and its territories. NSA ain't coming out, CIA won't both=

Men in Black, I bet you dimes to Martian quarters they aren't Americans (or=
 Earthlings).=20

, he is definately a dufus,=20
isn't authorized, and certainly isn't from the Pentagon (or any other such =
place. Area 51, UFO Island or=20
anywhere else) . If the guy comes to your door with a badge book and says "=
FBI"... ask him if he has a=20
warrant and then send him on his way if he doesn't.=20

Otherwise... don't get too wrapped up in being paranoid.=20

You have a way of upsetting people, and quickly. When they feel the must de=

them about, they come back with all guns a-blazing.=20

Seriously, you do have a problem with time travelers - so it seems, and you=

Unfortunately, none of us, except John can do that right now, and he isn't =
around.=20

I sort of suspected he vanish quietly - and he apparently has. So... rather=

Well, since you ask, I would attempt to describe my view in a clear and des=

your posts and your web site. I still do not understand *specifically* what=
 your view IS based on. You may=20
have stated these things in previous posts, but overall the tone you take i=
n presenting has made it=20
difficult to assemble an accurate picture of what it is you are trying to s=
ay. The objective in=20
presentations is to make it EASY for the 'viewer' to understand. The rhetor=
ic confuses your message.=20

"If you knew illegal drugs were bad and could kill your kids if they tried =
that, wouldn't you tell them,=20

335=20



I do know why certain drugs are illegal. I am aware that people die from th=

 and died. I have no kids, but=20
should I be so graced as to have them someday, I would raise them knowing t=

not violating trust issues involved in personal discussions. If said child =
were to somehow become involved=20

"All I did was answer Mel's questions, and I didn't even say every old pers=

Sorry. I was a tad too broad perhaps, but there is a valid point to make. S=

such a way that they themself do not see how others are reading\hearing it.=
 The way I read your comment=20

bowed to John like if he can't be wrong. To people who wouldn't listen to a=

Again, Its all in how you state things. The way in which you stated the she=

that everyone else were sheep. Again, you may not see that implication, but=
 it IS there.=20

"I hope this clarifies things"=20

Me too. I almost admire the enthusiasm you show, but as I see it, when enth=
usiasm is coupled with a hatred=20
of something it becomes a crusade. The crusades were over long ago. I urge =
you to re-evaluate your feeling=20
of hatred, but I will not suggest you rethink your view. Hate is such an ug=
ly emotion that it consumes=20
ones soul. I am not intending to offend you Javier and it is not my goal to=
 help everyone in the world,=20
but you have such a determined passion, it seems a waste to see that consum=

So my way is different. Is there a standard I have to follow?=20

Action if more my forte, defense might be another mans way of solving probl=

I'll try to be brief. At first, I thought 'smart rocks' sounded like a good=
 idea. Now, I do not. The only=20
practical purpose of having a 'smart rock' to me is to shoot down an incomi=
ng missile to keep the missile=20
from reaching the target. Leaving nuclear missiles in the ocean or explodin=

missiles in the ocean. They will corrode. They do find bombs from WWII yet.=

Okay, I admit that somewhere I am not up to par with these theories. But on=

been asked, and if I missed it I apologize.=20

Interesting theories, except "Who or what was the first time traveler?"=20

I am not debating whether John is real or not, nor if the theory supports t=
ime travel. Before humans went=20
into space, I think, if I ever think I remember, monkeys went into space. I=
 find that it would be=20
dishearting if all of a sudden, "we need a human operator of this device, b=
ecause a human must go in order=20
to get back." I think of a moral, ethical people, that some type of remote =
controls and initial flights=20
would be needed. Frankly, this type of time travel, even with 100% certaint=

this as no different, in this aspect, as it is for anyone of us to take a t=

that he/she/it may be from some elsewhen I have my doubts but I will allow =

 traitor's act. And is then=20

d Barn, SY.=20

Everyone should understand that I don't really consider Boomer to be a trai=
tor or a murderer principally=20
because I don't believe his story and secondarily because his online person=
a appears to be that of a=20
decent person.=20

What I attempted to point out is that the totality of a circumstance should=
 be considered in any analysis=20
of rhetoric. As Boomer spun the yarn he made some statements about his poli=
tical alignment that needed to=20
be addressed. There's more yet to be considered. For instance:=20

Let's 'jus 'spose once again that its all true. Boomer is a TT, a Major in =
the military (or former Major=20
now under civilian contract)of the regional nation of Florida (or whatever =
that region is called)and our=20
government is the enemy state in the war to begin in 2004. Let's also 'jus =
'spose that Rick really is a=20
former Military/DoD intelligence operative (and shooter)of that enemy state=
. Would Boomer, a trained field=20
grade military officer allow Rick within 1000 miles of his country's device=
? If Rick turned out to be a=20
"not-so-Ex" spook and managed to snatch the device with a little help from =
his friends what would prevent=20
we, the enemy state, from returning the machine to 2036 with a suitcase nuc=
lear device onboard?=20


339=20



Boomer has rather flippantly answered questions at times by saying that we =
can't affect his personal=20

timeline. While that may be true a retalliatory strike by us would affect s=
omeone's timeline. A 22 kt nuke=20
would mess up their entire afternoon if it went off in the lab upon the ret=
urn of the machine.=20

Again, its a great topic for discussion but Boomer isn't a TT. No country, =
past-present-future, would trust=20
such a powerful strategic device to Clodpole for the purpose of mixing both=
 a business trip and a personal=20
vacation. For the techno-military geeks: Have you ever heard of an Air FOrc=
e officer who took out an SR-71=20
Blackbird on a vacation trip - kind of on loan from DIA/NSA for a few month=
s. Same-same here.=20

Boomer may feel that a flip answer is OK, but his handlers wouldn't be quit=
e so confident that the machine=20
wouldn't be snatched.=20

Note for Rick: I agree with your earlier post that some sloppy detail work =
on military hardware or manuals=20
is common. PRC-25's, PRC-75's and other common communications hardware are =
old and utilitarian and treated=20
roughly.=20

Was sloppy workmanship and detailing on ICBM's, LA class nuke boats and nuc=
lear devices also your=20

experience? The machine and manual wouldn't be common grunt equipment that =
get humped in the boonies and=20
tossed into the hooch at night. Its two year old (in 2036) cutting edge str=
ategic technology developed by=20
GE and CERN (cyclorton) and cost billions of dollars. Is it your experience=
 that that sort of hardware is=20
treated with the same disdain as a field radio?=20

"what would prevent we, the enemy state, from returning the machine to 2036=

In your described 'jus' suppose scenario I had a couple thoughts that might=
 bring caution to the=20
possibility of ANY authority sending a suitcase in time. If I recall correc=
tly, John stated he has to=20
travel back to 1975 and then back to 2036. First, if I am correct with this=
 statement. The machine would=20
have to stop in '75 and it would stay there without a person in attendance =
thus blowing up somewhens 1975.=20
Second, do we know if a person has to be in the 'driver seat' of the Chevy =
to operate the machine? If so,=20
a suitcase nuke and a operator both go boom, thus a suicide mission. Also, =
Suppose an authority did that=20
suitcase trick. Suppose it gets to 2036. There will be a lot of surprised p=
eople in Florida. Well, 'what=20
if' the world line that received the suitacse happened to be ours when we r=
each 2036. OOPS!=20

Question=20

The suitcase thing is a suppose-it scenario that I cannot see anyone saying=
 "oh yeah great idea" about.=20

Seems that by and large the posts have been quite thorough and inquisitive,=
 but it is odd that John has not=20
posted since the 18th. I saw your post about him being out of town. Does th=
at mean he is back in town? If=20
so, there are loads of questions still to be asked.=20

As for the way the thread has spun toward its current path. Consider a clas=
sroom of 4th graders. If the=20
teacher leaves the classroom, does the class atmosphere take a spin toward =
another direction until the=20
teacher returns to bring things back to the original direction? Yes.=20

I am not using the above example as a literal application to this threads p=
osters or John, just the=20
concept.=20

Please consider that before frowning at the current status. I am certain ev=
eryone would be quite pleased if=20
john came on and fielded the concerns of those here. He did start the threa=
d and it would be appropriate=20
if he continued his dialogue or said thats it, time to skip the world lines=
.=20

If you have read back...except for yesterday...there have been many good qu=
estions left unanswered going way=20
back. In fact I cannot find a single response from John regarding anything =
I have asked, so I have not=20
been attempting to ask anything. Rather I have continued the interaction wi=
th others here. If you feel=20
that a TT would not come here because someone chooses to speculate on other=
 motives that are in the realm=20
of possibilty to stretched possibility, then so be it, but look close and s=
ee the suitcase stuff for what=20
it is. A speculation. Did anyone actually imply the application of that spe=

But Phil, it is an interesting twist. Star Trek never addressed questions l=
ike "If we have matter=20

dispacement, we'll beam a bomb aboard". All the tech from these made-up wor=
lds were so different that no=20
species could do that. Still, there are 'laws of nature' that are all the s=
ame.=20

How does 'tech' remain different if all 'laws of nature' are the same? That=
 does include all species in the=20
Universe to me, so far. We suppose that species would be different somehow,=
 but in the end because of the=20
'laws of nature' that may not be true. How do we know that John is not a al=
ien? At which point do humans=20

Nice to have you back! I concur with a lot of what Phil just posted. I, too=
, have asked several questions=20
to John and none of them was ever answered. Maybe he did not consider them =
"deep" enough to reply to, but=20
I felt that my questions were not of the sort that could be construed as a =
means for me to gain an unfair=20
advantage over someone else. For example, I asked if the NCAA still held a =
baskeball tournament, and if=20
so, was it still in its current format.=20

As for Darby's comment regarding placing a suitcase sized nuclear device in=
 John's time machine, that=20

appears to be a good and appropriate point in which to discuss. It falls wi=
thin the realm of philosphical=20
and moral implications that have previously appeared in this thread. I have=
 not really been able to place=20
my finger on just what it is that Javier has found so offensive about time =
travel in general, but this is=20
a scenario that might explain it. Maybe Javier fears Time Travelers doing t=
he reverse and bringing back=20
nuclear (or worse) devices into our time and setting them off in an act of =
terrorism.=20

Anyway, I am glad back to have you back in the discussion, Pamela. Do you t=

I didn't bring up the scenario of the suitcase. I did try and explain why I=

anyone to try it though. I see no error in logic there. You mention Star Tr=

there not a Genesis device that Kahn wanted to use as a weapon? That is a t=

doing. Of course from my current viewpoint, the theories and discussion her=

fantasy role play unless that role play becomes real thru solid proof.=20

I can only speak for myself, but I do not wish harm to anyone. Not a sole. =
As to John specifically, he has=20
not harmed me or my loved ones, so why should I desire to harm him. I would=

New Rule from God, perhaps: "Thou shall keep thy finger off of the nuclear =

"John stated that he did not understand why people would stay in the cities=

I actually think that the majority of people stay in the city because the e=

could not even contemplate=20
living anywhere but L.A., for example. Additionally, I also come across man=

or many of the people who would=20
choose to stay in a city.=20

I live in suburbia. Downtown L.A. is 35 miles from me as the crow flies. Th=
ere is the Seal Beach Naval=20
Weapons Station so close to me that I can just about see their fences. The =
only reason I am here is=20
because my wife will not move out of the region. I would prefer a rural set=

I'll propose another question to John. I like the validity of the TV show "=
StarGate". You need six points=20
of reference for a cube and a seventh reference, the point of origin, befor=
e you can travel through a=20
wormhole type time travel.=20

May be that I am missing something here. Further thought required.=20

The Universe is central to our existence, but we are central to the Univers=
e. Yet we have infinite multiple=20
'worldlines' of all time where we are 'yet' not a 'God' but are a 'God'. In=
teresting.=20

An interesting thought - Boomer and me - the same person. Imagine the philo=
sophical thought games that I'd=20
be playing with myself. Fortunately for me, I'm not him (I think he'd agree=
).=20

All=20

I posed the question of sending a device back to Boomer's lab in the machin=
e from the perspective of his=20
handlers. From their perspective we are the enemy upon whom they made war. =
Would they be willing to risk=20
even the smallest of possibility of having their machine fall into enemy ha=
nds and incur some sort of=20
retaliatory strike? Nuke, biological, chemical, or just a healthy dose of C=
4? Imagine the result of=20
blowing up the device with ordinary explosives. I don't know if I'd want tw=
o 3*10 A 18 kg black holes=20
auguring into my back yard.=20

Does it really make sense that his handlers would authorize a personal vaca=
tion with their billion-dollar=20
machine? It is, after all, a machine. Machines can break down. It's the res=
ult of a program that went live=20
in 2034. It has a computer - software, by definition, has bugs. Last I hear=
d we still have burglars in=20
Florida. While he's been hanging around some hype could steal his IBM 5100.=
 It may be a piece of junk but=20
would a junkie know that? When your nose is running and your skin is crawli=
ng and you want that smacked-=20
back feeling any port in the storm will do to get a fix - even Boomer's IBM=
 5100. If the machine were that=20
important to his handlers would they authorize a personal vacation and risk=
 losing the computer?=20

I dunno - how about you?=20

Albert, it is interesting that you mentioned "StarGate." That was one of my=

Daryby: Let's 'jus 'spose once again that its all true. Boomer is a TT, a M=
ajor in the military (or former=20
Major now under civilian contract)of the regional nation of Florida (or wha=
tever that region is called)and=20
our government is the enemy state in the war to begin in 2004. Let's also '=
jus 'spose that Rick really is=20
a former Military/DoD intelligence operative (and shooter)of that enemy sta=
te. Would Boomer, a trained=20
field grade military officer allow Rick within 1000 miles of his country's =
device? If Rick turned out to=20
be a "not-so-Ex" spook and managed to snatch the device with a little help =
from his friends what would=20
prevent we, the enemy state, from returning the machine to 2036 with a suit=
case nuclear device onboard?=20
Excellent! That was, I suppose one of the main reasons I tried to point out=
 several things, including the=20
fact that 1) he won't let me be "3rd party"=20

2) Anyone on this board might be a spook with just such a motive (though I =
SERIOUSLY doubt it).=20

Also Darby:Note for Rick: I agree with your earlier post that some sloppy d=
etail work on military hardware=20
or manuals is common. PRC-25's, PRC-75's and other common communications ha=
rdware are old and utilitarian=20
and treated roughly. Was sloppy workmanship and detailing on ICBM's, LA cla=

devices also your experience? The machine and manual wouldn't be common gru=
nt equipment that get humped in=20

cutting edge strategic=20
technology developed by GE and CERN (cyclorton) and cost billions of dollar=
s. Is it your experience that=20
that sort of hardware is treated with the same disdain as a field radio? Ri=
ght- Well, since I never dealt=20
with ICBMs, LA Class nuke subs, and other nuclear devices personally, I can=
't answer that. The truth is=20
though, that all military manuals have errors, even on ships. One last thin=
g... along these lines: For the=20
techno-military geeks: Have you ever heard of an Air FOrce officer who took=
 out an SR-71 Blackbird on a=20

 but just never stated it.=20

I will send it to Rick Donaldson to post on his board.=20

Hopefully he will post it soon.=20

As she stated, I have recieved said photograph and it is very, very interes=
ting. I find it almost funny in=20
a way. But, before I tell you about it, let me tell you something even funn=
ier - as in "Strange".=20


343=20



A few days ago, someone here on this list began to receive unsolicited emai=
l claiming they were from the=20
government. They have threatened certain persons here as well. I have for t=
he most part, successfully=20
discovered who that person is. He is from this list.=20

Tonight, shortly after Pamela posted her message about the "final proof", m=
y web site, and Anomalies.net=20
went down...=20

One of two possibilities exists right now. The sites reside in California a=
nd it is possible a power outage=20
caused the site to go offline. However, everything should have come back on=
line after power was restored.=20
I'm checking that right now and ought to have an answer sometime tomorrow m=
orning.=20

The second possibility is there has been an attack on the site. Something c=
alled a denial of service, if=20
anyone knows what that is. I've determined that INDEED there have been some=
 "hits" on the machines out=20
there - but at this point, I haven't confirmed it. I have people who are go=
ing to check though. If I find=20
out, and the IPs - correction, the ISP matches the person who is sending ou=
t threatening letters... I have a=20
sneaky suspicion the ONLY person being visited by the FBI or government age=
nts will be the perpetrator.=20

Some how... some folks seem to forget those of us in computer security have=
 means at our disposal not=20
normally assigned to the normal internet crowd.=20

So - that said., let me talk about the photograph since I can't post it ton=
ight.=20

The photo is a scan of a Florida Government document.=20

The exact gist of the document is regarding the fact that insurance has run=
 out on a specific vehicle and=20
needs to be renewed or some other action taken.=20

The name, and most of the vehicle information has been blanked for privacy-=
sake. But... the important part is=20
the date.=20

The date is 03/26/01=20

That's three days from today.=20

Unforntunately even for me, I find this to be no true explanation for John =
Titor, Time Traveler. As a "true=20
skeptic" (not of time travel, but rather believing that John IS a time trav=
eler) I realize that given the=20
fiasco of the Florida election process this past year, that Florida of ALL =
places is suspect when it comes=20
to government documents. It is in all likelyhood a typographical error. But=
, all of you can be the judge=20
(assuming my site is back online tonight). Otherwise, I willget the photo o=
nline as soon as humanly=20
possible. Yesterday, if I had a time machine.=20

I feel for John for having such a mixed-up youth, but even John should real=

Government probably is not interested in his 'time machine'. But you know p=
oliticians, they have probably=20
passed a law that John owes them some kind of tax for entering from a diffe=
rent worldline, even if from=20
the past or from the future. It is probably already as law in this day and =
age. John, you will have to pay=20
your tax before you leave. They have no need to poke you with needles or ta=

they will be very determined to collect their money. Why, heck, they do not=
 even care if you pay with=20
future money; since the debt is so large, and it would not even be paid off=
 in the future of 2036. You=20
would not want to leave small John with such a debt, would you?=20

What do you think John?=20

Yes, Pam, I have seen 'Contact', a while back. I think I remember some of i=

Such a grandly entertaining thread.=20

About two years back, on the old Art Bell BBS (which used to be highlighted=
 in that tiring blue, not this=20
pleasant green), there was a self-proclaimed time traveller (Marc "X") who =
had everyone in a tizzy for=20
about a month or so. The thread racked up hundreds of posts, it was often e=
xtremely funny, mostly for the=20
interplay between several posters, about 4 or 5 of whom were all named "Mar=
k".=20

The time-traveller, Marc X, claimed to be an anthropologist from the 22nd c=
entury. Unfortunately, in his=20
initial introductory post he spelt "anthropologist" wrong several times. Wh=
en this was duly pointed out to=20
him by one of the Marks, he defended himself by claiming that English had m=
orphed in the future, but that=20
he would do his best to adapt to our current patterns. This explanation bec=
ame his most common "out" when=20
in hot spots.=20

Marc was not stupid, but I must say that John Titor has him beat hands down=
. He not only has covered his=20
bases quite well, he has managed to disappear in a cloud of uncertainty tha=
t will at the worst leave some=20
wondering (though granted Darby seems to have stymied him in the physics de=
partment).=20


344=20



Marc X made the error of returning from periods of absence in an attempt to=
 offer rebuttals to attacks on=20
his claims, and to try to dodge and justify and explain his way out of too =
many loopholes. In the end he=20
failed. He was finally exposed, as someone tracked him down (the giveway be=
ing the "c" at the end of his=20
first name, which made his whole name actually uncommon) and located him as=
 a college student in a north=20
mid-west university. But as a prankster he did a good job, provided the mos=
t entertaining thread I ever=20
recall seeing on this BBS (outside of the "Oh My God" forum), and certainly=
 stimulated many to think.=20

I haven't been able to read every post in this thread, so I'm not sure if t=
his has been mentioned. But=20
John's explanation of a "Russian invasion" of the U.S. is strikingly remini=
scent of an obscure 1984=20
science fiction film called "Red Dawn", which dealt with just such a theme.=
 The idea seems so outlandish=20
that I can only wonder if "time-traveller John" didn't see that movie =E2=
=80=94 cheesie as it was.=20

I am listening to the archive at the moment and am currently 2 hours into i=

been people claiming to be the Anti-Christ. Will the real Anti-Christ pleas=
e stand up and smite the false=20
ones with pillars of fire? Or, better yet, do so on the air. That would ins=
pire some righteous ( or not-=20
so-righteous ) fear.=20

The few time travellers that called in really were not all that spectacular=
. None of them convincing, in my=20
opinion. Especially the one that talked about time travelling vacations via=
 pill, using nano-bots to send=20
the body back in time. Sounds a little too much like that show "Time Trax".=
 Now, if someone were capable=20
of time travelling into the near future, say 30 minutes, then come back and=
, on the air, tell everyone who=20
would call and what they would say, then that would be interesting.=20

Apparently, though, most time travellers come from 2008 and jump back to 20=
01 for some reason. Why 2001 is=20
beyond me ( of course, we're only 3 months into it ) when 4004 BC would be =

Why do you consider 'Red Dawn' an obscure science fiction film? Maybe we're=
 not thinking the same movie,=20
but your mention of the russian factor is pretty telling. It might be specu=

.=20

ALL:=20

I think the line between observations, theories, dreams, past expereinces a=

both the medium here and the participants. So what? As long as ideas are ex=

establisment' s version of the facts ... there is something to be learned f=
rom such actions too =E2=80=94 just lets=20
stop letting our knee-jerk reactions kick each other around.=20

What does plausibility of a story have to do with the reality of events ind=

I have compiled all of the writing that has been done by John Titor, alledg=

Let me explain.=20

John stated at one point he would not make any. In at least two other place=

morals for not doing so.=20

However... I find it very difficult myself to not make predictions.=20

could answer any questions presented to us by that population with whom we =
would interact.=20

At that point, people start asking you about the future. Though your person=

"predictions", they do not stop you from answering well placed questions ab=
out yourself, the time travel=20
aspect, and even perhaps some vague history of yourself (Future to everyone=
 else).=20

Within that aspect, you will give answers regarding the future that were ei=

I place before you the supposition that John Titor, Alledged Time Traveler =
has done just so. In the thread=20

 post my list of possible=20
predictions to a future Earth.=20

al, but I don't like it one=20
bit.=20

This is apparently one of the folks claiming military connections and askin=
g folks to shut up. Well..=20

I don't like cowards. I don't people telling me to shut up either. If you w=
ant to talk to me, my email=20
address is public. Feel free to write. I certainly want to hear from you in=
 person. Until then, suffice it=20
to say, I do not require 'enlightenment' from you or anyone else.=20

As far as whether or not "is he or isn't he" this is a free country in whic=
h I live so I am entitled to my=20
opinion on this subject. I don't care if you wrote every manual in the US g=
overnment. You're way off base=20
attacking me, THROUGH someone else, and privately.=20

You're a coward. Come out from hiding and admit who you really are instead =
of using innocent go-betweens.=20
You haven't a clue what you're talking about when you refer to me. You also=
 haven't a clue what a "future=20
manual" might look like, no more than I have a clue about it.=20

You see... If John were from the future, and the items I've already posted =
on another thread are even=20

remotely true, the government as you know it now, and publications standard=
s ARE NOT what you think they=20

are. So... smart ass - either come out in public, or shut up.=20

In the mean time, answer me here - in Public. And before I hear any bitchin=
g about "private email" remember=20
this, you SENT IT TO ME THROUGH A THIRD PARTY - therefore it is MINE TO DO =
WITH AS I WISH, and I wish to=20
release it to the public domain, right here on this board. Now... if you wa=

privately. Until then, keep your mouth shut and leave the middle people out=

For the technical publication itself (including cover/title page), mil-spec=

Posted by John Titor on 03-24-2001 06:19 PM=20

I will be leaving this worldline shortly and this will be my final post. Th=
ere are only a handful of people=20
who will know exactly when I will be leaving and I'm sure they will let you=
 know when I'm gone.=20

In the last few days I have found your choice of topics quite interesting a=
nd from an objective viewpoint I=20
think it collectively answers one of your own questions, "If time travel is=
 real, where are all the time=20
travelers?" In the past, I have stated that quite frankly, you all scare th=
e Hell out of me and I'm sure=20
other temporal drivers would feel the same. But now I have an expanded expl=
anation with two examples.=20

A while ago (on one of the posts), I related an experience I had with my pa=
rents while we were driving down=20
a highway. Every now and then, we would pass someone who was in obvious dis=
tress with their vehicle. I was=20
amazed that so many people could pass them by without stopping to help. The=
ir explanation was fear. The=20
risk of helping someone was too great and with today's technology, they pro=
bably had a cell phone anyway.=20
If they didn't, the walk to a gas station would be good for them and teach =
them a lesson for running out=20
of gas.=20

The other example is the plight of the homeless. When you pass them as indi=
viduals on the street I see the=20
way people selectively choose an alternate path to avoid them.=20

Those two examples best define why time travelers do not show themselves. I=
n trying to help you, we put=20
ourselves as great risk and there's really no point to it. We know the natu=
re of time dictates that=20
traveling between "exact" worldlines is impossible. Therefore, the only res=
ults we will see will be the=20
ones we stay to see. Since worldlines, outcomes and events are infinite, we=
 have better things to do. When=20
I arrive in the "new" 1998 worldline on my way home I could easily start al=
l of this again and continue to=20
go through the same conversations with all of the same people. However, I a=
lready know you won't pay any=20
attention or believe me because we've already been through it on this world=
line. Besides, I think the walk=20
to the gas station will do you some good.=20


The following are the last questions I saw before my "going home" post. I a=
pologize for not being able to=20
get to all of them.=20

ROBERT:=20

((Do most of the people of that time die out, especially ones that currentl=
y have health problems?))=20

Yes, and people are still dying and a great deal of them are passing from C=
JD. As I said, with my very=20
first few posts almost 6 months ago, I want to emphasize how devastating th=
is will be. I believe two=20
people are confirmed dead in Colorado from CDJ from surgical instruments. A=
hhhh, the power of cheese. Milk=20
does a body good and beef is what's for dinner!=20


348=20





Me: "No, I have not tried any fast food. Thinking about where the food came=
 from, how it was shipped and=20
treated absolutely terrifies me. I have tried to tell people about CJD dise=
ase and it seems to be=20
"catching on" in Europe."=20

Me: Do not eat or use products from any animal that is fed and eats parts o=
f its own dead.=20

Me: The "Mad Cow" story here is yet to begin...=20

((Is it possible that sometime in your future or in your present time that =
time travel will be=20
commonplace?))=20

Yes, that is absolutely possible and eventual.=20

((Have any of the scientists of your time discovered any new planets, possi=
bly ones with life?))=20

Not that I'm aware of.=20

((Has the bandwidth of the Internet increased greatly?))=20

Yes.=20

((And finally, one last question...how did Texas fare during the war?))=20

Texas is still there but Spanish is a lot more popular.=20

DAN:=20

((How does time travel affect our future (no pun intended) exploration of t=
he universe? It seems that the=20
greatest obstacles in our way right now are a matter of energy (propulsion =
technology) and economic=20
feasibility. It seems to me that time travel technology could neatly takes =
care of both.))=20

There is a great deal of debate about trying to use a distortion unit to "t=
ravel" to the moon. The=20
experiment would require very precise calculations that would allow the VGL=
 system to find a theoretical=20
path to the moon on a different worldline. The only problem is there is no =
way to communicate with anyone=20
if the experiment should succeed. In other words, it's possible to do it bu=
t only the people on the=20
receiving end could take advantage of it.=20

DAVID:=20

((My oldest son wanted me to ask if you have any siblings.))=20

No, I am an only child.=20

((Also, are you still planning on broadcasting your departure via a broadca=
st over the Internet? That would=20
be quite interesting.))=20

My father will be videotaping the departure. I appreciate Rick's offer but =
my primary concern is the=20

anonymity of my family. In addition, my departure will be in a somewhat pub=
lic place and I do not want to=20
draw additional attention to myself. At no fault of his own, I would also s=
ubmit that Rick's involvement=20
would not add any credibility to the event.=20

((Is there still an NCAA basketball tournament in 2036, and if so, has it e=
xpanded from its current 64-team=20
format?))=20

Yes, we still play basketball but I am not a fan and can't comment on its o=
rganization.=20

ALBERT:=20

((Interesting anyway, hoped you used some of the links.=20

Thanks.))=20

Yes I did, thank you.=20

JOE:=20

((You say that you wear some kind of flight suit like coveralls when you ar=
e time traveling and that you=20
experience 2 g's for 6-8 hrs. How is it possible to withstand that kind of =
g-force for such a long period=20
without the use of an anti-g suit?))=20

The average human can take 2 G's without too much difficulty. Blackout occu=
rs at about 8 or 9 Gs and redout=20
occurs at negative 3 Gs.=20

((I know you must be physically trained for space travel, but you should al=
so have the benefit of equipment=20
to help you out.))=20

We are encouraged to stay physically fit.=20

EMMETT:=20

In an effort to address Emmett's comments, (and in all fairness) the follow=
ing posts are out of context and=20
not in order. If I'm not a real time traveler I would suggest that Emmett i=
s at a disadvantage on his=20
tactics to "expose" me.=20

If I present a picture of a sea monster to you and I claim it's real you ar=
e forced to argue its validity=20
on the basis of the evidence that I present or create. Under these circumst=
ances, you can't win. If you=20
look at the picture and argue that sea monsters should have more teeth or t=
heir incisors are not in=20
proportion to the amount of fish they eat, it's easy to ask you how you kno=
w so much about sea monsters if=20
they don't exist. Granted, you could point to dinosaur skeletons and make c=
omparisons. But I can still=20
say, its not a dinosaur, it's a sea monster. In fact, I could even "whip" u=
p some tooth marks on a piece=20
of petrified wood and prove to you don't know anything about sea monsters.=
=20

((I realize that you haven't given "all of the technical details" of the de=
vice...so, the reparte has been=20
fun. But your device, as described, simply won't work.))=20

If you don't have all the details, how do you know it doesn't work?=20

((Honestly, I'm not upset about any of this...and the only emotion involved=
 for me is joy. This is fun! It=20
really is.)=20

Joy?=20

Emmett drew the following assumptions from our conversation and I don't bel=
ieve I said any of them.=20

((The universe that you described, that is, one where mass is accelerated t=
o light speed and forms a=20
singularity doesn't exist.))=20

((1. As you accelerated to light speed in your machine you and your machine=
 formed a black hole.))=20

((2. From your perspective as you accelerated to light speed every other ob=
ject in the universe formed a=20
black hole due to your relative velocities))=20

((Take a close look at the technical drawing. Look especially at the left a=
nd right end perspectives. Not=20
the same - very poor quality CAD for a billion dollar project.))=20

A billion? How do you know it's a CAD drawing?=20


349=20


((If you have contact with Boomer please attempt to verify the elapsed time=
 (on his internal chronometer)=20
for his trip from 2036 to 1975. I need that data for a calculation.))=20

The first leg takes me to 1998. I think I said that quite a few times.=20

((He also said that the mass of the singularities is that of a "small mount=
ain".))=20

If that were true, the unit could not be moved. I only refrenced the mass o=
f a small mountain in one of our=20
physics conversations. In fact, I believe I said the mass for the singulari=
ties in the distortion unit was=20
much smaller.=20

((The last time I checked the physics I didn't see an "on-off" switch for a=
 black hole or any other=20
singularity.))=20

Me neither. I don't believe I said you could turn it on or off.=20

((At 2 g acceleration you will be traveling just a tad faster than a Chevy =
pick-up in short order (about=20
one year to reach light speed).))=20

This is the one that really disappoints me. Even you should know that Einst=
ein's thought experiment in the=20
isolated elevator was based on the idea that the effects of acceleration an=
d gravity are the same. I never=20
said acceleration had anything to do with how the unit operates.=20

((Does it really make sense that his handlers would authorize a personal va=
cation with their billion-dollar=20
machine?))=20

I'm looking at my orders and I don't see the word vacation on it anywhere. =
You had my hopes up for a=20
moment. Interesting how quickly a billion-dollars has become a fact now.=20

((And, though he's never said that he hasn't let anyone else come close to =
the machine, who took the=20
picture of his two hands in one of the photos?))=20

When did I say that? I'll have to let Pamela explain the laser pointer pict=
ure. She may already have posted=20
the email I sent earlier.=20

Here are a few other comments I found interesting:=20

((The answer to the question, "How does a person born in 1998 use the langu=
age...?" is - who knows?))=20

I agree. How would you know?=20

((The two yellow caution tapes on the device are misaligned. Sloppy workman=
ship.))=20

I'll have to point that out to my "handlers" when I get back.=20

((I suppose that if you were interested in verification of Boomer's science=
 that you could go right to the=20
source. Dr. Frank Tipler, Tulane University, for an interview.))=20

He's a very pleasant gentleman. I highly recommend his book. The Physics of=
 Immortality. I believe I made=20
reference to this earlier.=20

( (...what would prevent we, the enemy state, from returning the machine to=
 2036 with a suitcase nuclear=20
device onboard?))=20

This is the second time I've seen a reference to the unit as a weapon. I wo=
uld submit that the people of=20
this worldline have nothing to fear from me. What would you do with the uni=
t?=20

( (J.C. ...I like the way Darby thinks) )=20

Now there's an endorsement.=20

For more information on black holes and sigularities, I did find this site.=
=20

http://www.rdrop.com/users/green/school/primordi.htm=20

In your opinion, what is the smallest mass that can form a singulairty? Eve=
n Hawking suggested primordial=20
singularities were created at the Big Bang. Were there planets (or half pla=
nets) around to form them then?=20

Based on your ability to draw conclusions about someone's profile from thei=
r typed words I find it hard to=20
believe you would make such errors in the syntax and meaning of the exact s=
ame words. Unfortunately, you=20
have now maneuvered yourself into a position where I have the last word and=
 our debate must has come to an=20

mentioned time after time, how much I dislike opportunist and those that ex=
ploit people.=20

Rick: Javier - I am not now, nor have I ever been an opportunist. I don't l=
ike them either. Also - let me=20
say this about respect, and even influence. Those are things that people ha=
ve to earn. I earn mine with my=20
family, grandkids, work and in general with my friends. I don't have to wor=
k hard at it. I'm honest and I=20
mean something when I say it. I don't insult people - not on purpose, and I=
 certainly do not go around=20
talking down to them. As far as bumping heads, I don't think you and I are =
very far off on our thinking. I=20
just approach it in a vastly different way than you do.=20

Javier: But personally, I respect you, and think you can be as much a passi=

Rick: Thanks. I think.=20

Javier: Just a tad disappointing how much you endorse John like you do... O=

is gone now. What he's left=20

behind will be people's gospel. Sad but true. Well, it's a good thing this =
board has a TimeTravelActivist .=20
To ensure that the other=20

side that never gets talked about, does.=20

Rick: Let's get something very clear. I've not endorsed anyone for anything=
 here. I am NOT endorsing John,=20
or you, Ernie Vega, Pamela, or anyone else. Can you not make any comments w=
ith you lowering yourself to=20
insulting people? (i.e. "Brown nosing"). Is that what you think life is all=
 about? Seeing how 'witty' and=20
'smartassed' you can be? It isn't. There is a very old saying that goes "Yo=
u can catch more flies with=20
honey than vinegar". It was true in my Great Grandmother's day, and it is t=
rue today. John is gone, but=20
certainly not forgotten. His words are not "gospel" to anyone. No one here =
is the "sheep" you called them=20
before. I personally am insulted at that term applied equally to everyone a=
s you have done in the past. A=20
sheep is someone who blindly follows, believes for no other reason than the=
y feel they must. The people=20
here not only are intelligent (some are outwardly brilliant) but they are t=
hinking people who have=20
considered as much of this material as they could get their hands on before=
 making any rash statements=20
about "following someone". I've not seen anyone here do that. I'm sure you'=
ve felt that Pamela is one of=20
those sheep. The problem is, Javier, you don't know her personally (neither=
 do I), but apparently she has=20
seen some material we have not. That gives her the right to believe whateve=
r she wishes. Not only that, if=20
I had been there and actually seen a time machine, and then watched as it l=
eft - I too would believe it.=20

My own eyes rarely lie to me.=20

But - I wouldn't expect anyone here to believe ME because I SAID it happene=
d. I could just as well be lying=20
about it too. However, I would tell the truth of what I saw, and let you ma=
ke the decision for yourself=20
whether you wanted to trust what I said or not. I wouldn't insult you for n=
ot believing me. I do see, and=20
understand both sides of this story.=20

What John has left behind will be debated by both sides for some time to co=
me. I venture to guess a few=20
months. No more, and like other things on the internet it will fade away an=
d be forgotten. You're young,=20
almost 21 -right? You will for get this in time and it will be just one oth=
er feather in your cap that you=20
can say "I won the debate. The time traveler couldn't prove himself to me, =
so I win".=20

Javier, my friend, that isn't what this was about. John placed some informa=
tion before us for debate. Not=20
for attack. A good argument isn't about attacking the other side, a good ar=
gument brings out all the good=20
and bad points both sides have, and it allows the spectators to make a deci=
sion regarding the data. To=20
many of us for too long have been exposed to the media in this country wher=
e a good arguemnt is a good=20
attack, along with mudslinging and dirt. Debates should not include barbaro=
us attacks, name calling, mud=20
slinging or calling into question a person's integrity (unless everything b=
eing stated is a lie - but=20
you've got to PROVE IT IS A LIE). Nothing here can ever be construed to hav=
e been a lie. Nor, on the other=20
hand can we believe it is the truth at this point. We're precisely where we=
 were when we started!=20

The person who attacked me in private was too cowardly to come forth and po=
st their information here on the=20
board - so I did it for them. They were right about certain things - about =
manuals and about the way=20
things are accomplished in the government - with one caveat... nothing is p=
erfect, especially manuals=20
produced by contractors for the government. Neither are proceedures, and ce=
rtainly neither are the=20
arguments that you and I have put forth. But they didn't prove anything by =
their statements, any more than=20
I have (which I think is what upset me the MOST with the personal attack in=
 email. I wasn't trying to=20
PROVE anything, I was making a simple, and TRUTHFUL statement about governm=
ent manuals. Someone just took=20
it personally!)=20


353=20



John has not proven anything. But worse still, because of the lack of infor=
mation, NONE of us has proven=20
one thing. You have not proven he is not a time traveler. I haven't proven =
one way or the other he is a=20

time traveler. John did not prove he was.=20

I can only say from the number of hits on the thread that the discussion wa=
s good, and there was some=20
intelligence placed here in this thread that I hope at leasts makes Keith R=
owland, his wife and Art Bell=20
proud. Some of the people I've discussed this subject with, offline, have t=
old me that the BBS was being=20

checked out by some government folks - mostly tongue in cheek - to see if t=
here might be some truth to=20

what John said. They have pulled pictures from my site as well as Doc's org=
inal site and examined them for=20
anything they could get.=20

The one thing that leaves me in doubt about the entire episode is the pictu=
re of the time machine. I have=20
contacted people in several fields and sent the picture along for examinati=
on. It is 1) a home built=20
device or 2) it is exactly what it seems at this point.=20

No one can identify the object as being anything else produced in the past =
so far. What I'm getting at is=20
this device doesn't match any pre-2001 military equipment. At least not tha=
t we've been able to locate so=20
far. I've got some experts on this too, folks who *1* believe when they tel=
l me something. So, if one=20
comes through and finds out what this thing is, I will certainly let everyo=
ne know.=20

Until then, it remains inconclusive in my eyes. Personally, I would like to=
 believe John., for several=20
reasons.=20

I want to believe time travel is possible, but more importantly, I want to =
believe John's stories of his=20
history - and to look for ways to change things on our time line BEFORE THO=
SE THINGS COME TO PASS.=20

My job has been and always will be to help the human race go forward - neve=
r backward. If I can find ways=20
to stop a nuclear war, I certainly will do so. However, if I can't and it c=
omes to a Civil War - I will=20
always fight on the side of Freedom. Always. I always have, and I certainly=
 always will.=20

The human race does not depends on me, nor Javier, nor John. It depends on =
the collective concious of the=20
entire planet full of people to do the right thing. Sometimes, those who ar=
e misguided do the wrong thing=20
and take down with them thousands of people. WE are here, in the here and n=
ow, regardless of whether John=20
is a time traveler. His interaction with us has changed NOTHING. His leavin=
g changes NOTHING.=20

What WE DO from now on out however, will make all the difference in the wor=
ld for our histories. Keep that=20
in mind as you (Javier) continue your investigation and being a "Time Cop".=

I understand your points. But does anyone understand mine? You said that th=

Like Rick said, you do analysing with facts and knowledge. It does not make=

opinion you hold, that would get everyone nowhere. Maybe its a well thought=
 scenario of what could happen,=20
and one can not tell.=20

But, we do have certain attitudes in this country that do not help with any=

is the case then perhaps some can watch others in action. I certainly welco=

doing. Everything can be faked up to a point, but intelligent discussion wi=

for all. Contrary to public opinion, it does not make anyone 'act' a certai=

Fore-knowledge becomes a great advantage if done properly. And after all, t=

That may take some patience. I also have notified someone else that may 'lo=

doubt that he would have the 'resources' of Rick, so I thank Rick for doing=

this. Plus some events are 'happening' now, mad-cow stuff to start, and I k=

Citizens will respond that need too, and everyone else listens to 'it' on t=

Javier: Because for the past 18 years of my life, I have always wanted to T=
ime Travel to the past and to=20
the future, and change things to my liking. Since I would always feel that =
I could Time Travel, intense=20
sensations and visions. Made me feel that someday I will.=20

Rick: Javier - shame on you. haha. I can see very clearly where that is goi=
ng. Let me give you an analogy.=20

I carry a weapon most everywhere I go. No one sees it. I carry it for vario=
us reasons, but in the past=20
I've been attacked and my life has been threatened. I do not take kindly to=
 folks doing that, and intend=20
to keep myself mentally as well as physically prepared to defend myself if =
I must. I won't hesitate to do=20
so if attacked. Now... why I am telling you this.=20

There are people out there, who feel because *1* carry a gun, I am a danger=
 to everyone around me. At this=20
point in my life, the only people I've ever shot at were those who shot fir=
st at me. And I've only ever=20
drawn my weapon ONCE when a prowler was around the backyard. He turned out =
to be a Cop who'd not=20

identified himself. But, the point of this., the people who think that I am=
 a danger because I carry a gun=20

do so out of fear.=20

They think that because if THEY HAD A GUN, THEY WOULD GET MAD AND PULL IT O=
UT in an altercation in a car=20
(road rage). They equate me, to them. But Javier, I am not them. They are n=
ot me. Perhaps they WOULD pull=20

out a gun if they had one and shoot someone. Anyone who feels this shouldn'=
t carry one.=20

If you haven't considered the possibilities of carrying a gun, and the rami=
fications of having to use one=20
in self-defense, you shouldn't carry one.=20

By the same token, if you believe that you would take a time machine and ab=
use the power it might give you=20

- that is, changing things to the way YOU like them, then you should not no=
w, or ever travel back in time,=20

even if it is possible.=20

That I believe is what John was saying about "psychologically sound". If I =
am to be on a rescue mission=20
with the military, and it would entail killing others to save some... I TOO=
 would get my chance to go=20
through psychological evaluation. If I could not pull the trigger on the ba=
d guys, I would not be going on=20
that trip. By the same token, those who do not understand human life, and w=
hat living - and dying, is=20

about, should not put themselves in the position of defending themselves (s=
ometimes, they simply have no=20

choice but to do so though).=20

Finally, if you had your hands on a time machine, you would definately abus=
e it. Therefore, you are doing=20
what we call in the psychological arena - Transference. Just like the antig=
unners do with me.=20

You're transfering the 'evilness' of a time machine to someone other than y=
ourself, because deep down, you=20
KNOW YOURSELF YOU WOULD abuse it!=20

So - now we have discovered something in this forum after all... The psycho=
logical make up of a time cop!=20
hahaha=20

Randy: It does answer my questions ... and prompts a few more ... you might=
 run into them on that other thread=20
if I can remember to get over there. But the short version is: Are they ind=
ications of what will be or may=20
be? And can they really be termed predictions if they were not intended to =
be such?=20

If you mean, specifically, the things in the other thread... Consider for a=
 moment you're a time traveler.=20

You go back to, say 1800. People talk to you in the local tavern and you te=
ll them stories of the future,=20
but promise yourself not to give away anything specific.=20

In your quest to do so, you attempt to keep dates vague, and never mention =
names like Alexandar Graham=20
Bell, Tesla, Ford, President Hoover... nothing like that. Instead you're va=
gue and you mention there are two=20
world wars by the time 2000 comes around. You even tell them the years they=
 started, but nothing specific=20
about the dates, or who started them or how. You might mention an "evil man=
 in Germany". You might mention=20
things like the Gulf War. You might talk about going to the moon, but not M=
ars. You might talk about the=20
industrial revolution - which really begins roughly around 1900. One hundre=
d years from the date of your=20
visit. You mention cars, even specific kinds of cars with internal combusti=
on engines and that they use=20
refined oil out of the ground to power them. You might mention atomic weapo=
ns.=20

In all your talk, NONE of these things are specific enough to tell someone =
about the future except in vague=20
terms, right? Let's see what I just wrote (all off the top of my head).=20

1) World War 1=20

2) World War 2=20

3) Gulf War=20

4) Man goes to moon=20

5) Man does NOT go to Mars=20

6) The industrial revolution starts around 1900=20

7) You said you own a cinsert car type here&gt;=20

8) Something better than steam... internal combustion.=20

9) Oil comes from the ground. Wow, they make money using it!=20

10) Oil is refined into petrol., gasoline.=20

11) Six guns aren't gonna be the gun of the future, atomic weapons with the=
 power of exploding volcanoes=20
(something even the normal crowd in 1800 probably wouldn't know much about)=
.=20

In other words, in a simply, unassuming conversation such as what John had =
with us - and again assuming he=20
is really a time traveler - tells us a LOT of information.=20

This my friend is what we call intelligence gathering.=20

If I take 60 news papers from around the world and I read everything in the=
m, I will gather more=20
intelligence in the time I read those papers then you will from watching te=
levision for a couple of days.=20

Our own intel gathering forces in the US do precisely what I've just descri=
bed. *1* gather intelligence in=20
the same manner, without contacting "official intel sources". The point is,=
 each and everyone of us has a=20
better chance of knowing as much as the CIA knows, if we put our minds to i=
t.=20

So, what I have done with the "intelligence" I've gathered is to simply tak=
e it apart, precisely as he=20
stated it. Now, we have two possibilities.=20

He is a time traveler.=20

He is not a time traveler.=20

Applying logic (which of course is difficult without a known truth) you can=
 get the possibilities of the=20
future based on the presumption he is from the future. Plus or Minus a 2.5%=
 deviation (his numbers, not=20
mine) .=20

If you assume he is NOT a time traveler, then it is moot. None of this will=
 come true - at least not in the=20
order he said or the dates, or times. In truth, there is roughly a 25% chan=
ce of ANYTHING coming true if=20
you predict it. That is statistically probale. If you make a prediction, yo=
u can count on the fact it will=20
probably come true, eventually, but you have only a 25% chance of making a =
guess - a stab in the dark.=20
Experiments in the paranormal hold this to be true. In about 1973 and 74 I =
participated in ESP and=20
telepathy experiments. I was hitting 60-80 percent accuracy. I have reason =
to believe that there is some=20
kind of Extrasensory perception that exists. I wouldn't count on it - but I=
 certainly DO listen to that=20
little voice inside my head that says "Do not turn here, turn at the next b=
lock". If I don't something=20
almost always happens that I didn't want to have happen. Will I go out and =
say that there IS DEFINATELY=20
ESP? No... because I only know for sure what I know, and can't prove it. I =
don't expect others to believe=20
me.=20

Does John Titor exist? I can't even be sure he does. I'm pretty positive Jo=
hn exists, and John Titor might=20
or might not be his real name. It might simply be another nom de plume - pe=
n name. In either case, he=20
exists as SOMEONE and has been posting messages. All the messages, from the=
 language, dialect and wording=20
(including consistent misspellings) come from the same guy - at leats in my=
 opinion.=20

If I had to guess, I would say John is very similar to what - I think Darby=
 said - and that his background=20
is similar in some respects as mine. Some military service of some sort, an=
d he has a degree of patience=20
that would escape me quickly. So - I have to make SOME assumptions to place=
 this information/intelligence=20
in the light in which it belongs.=20

Suspect. As long as the information is suspect, we can never come up with a=
 true answer to the question of=20
whether John is a real TT or not. WE CAN come up with some other answers th=
ough. Watch and check the data=20
over time. If his "predictions" start coming true, consistently... he is a =
time traveler, or a prophet.=20

I hope I got what you were asking in this message.=20

((Is John Titor your real name?))=20

Yes, John Titor is a real name.=20

Johns response using " 'a' real name" is curious for it is an unusual way t=

that John Titor is indeed a real name in the sense that he is using the nam=

Indeed - that is a date to remember. It is Hitler's birtday, it was the day=
 of the attack at Columbine.=20
Lemme see... I think that was also the day they burned Waco. I am sure it w=
as around the 19th of April.=20
Anyway, the 20th was the Oklahoma City bombing. I don't remember the date a=
t Ruby Ridge. Perhaps some one=20
else can come up with that?=20

In any case, the 19th is a day that federal agencies are on alert. All of t=
hem. The military goes on a=20
ThreatCon (Threat Condition) Alpha and some time Bravo. Both are increased =
threat conditions, merely=20
meaning there is the possibility of an increased threat.=20

The BATF, and the IRS also go on increased alerts on that date, or just pri=
or. They are afraid of the=20
public. Seems like they have a good reason. But, that is neither here nor t=
here. Those agencies, the FBI,=20
CIA and anyone else within the confines of the United States considers that=
 day dangerous for anyone with=20
any connections to the government.=20

So - April 19th is a 'date to remember' for several reasons. I can't see th=
at is a prediction, and it's why=20
I didn't include it. Perhaps he means something will happen on this 19th Ap=
ril 2001? I dunno. You might=20
wanna add that to the list, but I considered it a normal 19th of April as I=
 described above.=20

In the case of John's name, I think I was trying to say that no matter what=
 his "birth name" is/was/will=20
be, it is unimportant to the matter of whether he is a time traveler. Names=
 simply aren't that important=20
unless they have to be historically accurate. In our case, John Titor is th=
e know we know him by, so it is=20
likely a real name. By the way, I have not attempted to track down John Tit=
or... and probably will not. I'm=20

- even if I DID find out, I=20

First off, you don't know me; you're not a psychologist, or a profiler. Sec=

I'm even surprised at you Rick; you of all people would attack my sincerity=

Phil, you're right. I added some more to that post even after you read it. =
Check it again. But, assuming=20
that "Waco-like" incidents occur this 19th of April, they will be chalked u=

of such dates. On the other hand, I'm not planning on leading a revolution =
(not unless and until they=20
start going door to door for our guns, haha then it is too late to NOT lead=
 a revolution! LOL)=20

John didn't give us anything other than what I might predict though. I know=
 for instance that all bases go=20

I find it interesting that John said that the name is of a real named perso=

John Titor listed for the Chesapeca (Spelling) Cemetary in PA(Pennsylania =

From Emmett's link:=20

Since the first two breakthroughs could require breakthroughs in energy gen=
eration, and since the physics=20
underlying the propulsion goals is closely linked to energy physics, it is =
also of interest to discover=20
fundamentally new modes of energy generation. The principle phenomena of in=
terest for this category is,=20
again, the vacuum fluctuations. It has been theorized that this energy can =
be extracted without violating=20
conservation of energy or any thermodynamic laws (Forward 1984, Cole 1993).=
 It is still unknown if this=20
vacuum energy exists as predicted, how much energy might be available to ex=
tract, and what the secondary=20
consequences would be of extracting vacuum energy.=20

Special relativity states that the speed of light is an upper limit for the=
 motion of matter through=20
spacetime. Recently, however, theories using the formalism of general relat=
ivity have suggested that this=20
limit can be circumvented by altering spacetime itself. This includes wormh=
ole and warp drive theories. A=20
wormhole is a shortcut created through spacetime (Morris 1988 and Visser 19=
95), as illustrated in Figure=20
3, where a region of spacetime is warped to create a shorter path between t=
wo points. A warp drive=20
involves the expansion and contraction of spacetime to propel a region of s=
pacetime faster than light=20
(Alcubierre 1994). Figure 4 illustrates the Alcubierre warp drive, showing =
the opposing regions of=20
expanding and contracting spacetime that propel the center region.=20

During the workshop these possibilities were discussed with an emphasis on =
experimental verification. A=20
poster by Forward suggested a search for evidence of negative mass based on=
 recent astronomical data (da=20
Costa 1996). The posters of Dinowitz, Froning, Ringermacher, and Woodward a=

their theories. Several experiments were suggested to test the theories lin=
king inertia to vacuum=20
fluctuations, including experiments described in existing literature (Forwa=
rd 1996). And interest was=20
expressed in continuing the experiments to test the claims of weight change=
s over spinning superconductors=20
(Li 1997).=20

Theories that could be used instead for 'Time Travel' not=20

Interesting thread, I must say.=20

Well, the jury seems out, and I must say John TT was quite interesting. How=
ever. Here is where he slipped=20
up:=20

On his last post, he mentioned the phrase "Milk does a body good and beef i=
s what's for dinner!"=20

The fact that a man from 2036 knows of these two ad campains strikes me as =
pretty odd, as they are pretty=20
old hat even now.=20

The other issue is that these ad campains died out roughly 6 to 7 years ago=
, which if John was visiting=20
himself as a baby in 2001, he would have also missed television references =
to said ad campaigns. Only one=20
who LIVED through those times would have and will have these slogans engrai=
ned in our common pop culture,=20
which to an outsider would be pretty obscure. The ads were also not present=
 in 1976 either, where John=20
supposedly visited.=20

I deduce that John TT knows these slogans not from Old magazines or TV, or =
because someone "now" told him,=20
but because he lived through those periods, just like everyone else on the =
planet.=20

It was a simple slip up.=20

But a slip up indeed it was. Nice try, but no dice, John.=20

Is it possible that he picked it up from someone or some ad during his visi=

John TT himself mentioned his disdain for slang, and in our modern pop cult=

The fact is, we (you and I) speak with a lingo and dialect formed by such p=
op culture expereinces relevant=20

 of speech we use now would be=20
totally not understood if one were to go back to the 1930 's or 40's.=20

Ie, expressions like "Cut yourself a slice of rug" or "Putting on the dogs"=

"Way gone", "It's a gasser" etc. etc. would be as confusing to someone in o=

If I went back to 1935 and mentioned someone was "fly" or "Funky fresh and =

a Spaz". You get the point.=20

The fact is, that someone from 2036 would have a totally different set of s=

Some things about John...=20

I was reading over some of these postings and I just wanted to make a few c=
omments.=20

somebody mentioned John might be a Russian (I think Albert?) and another th=
at he may be from England (I=20

think Rick?)=20

anyway I just wanted to say I don't beleive John is either .=20

I will tell you why...=20

For one thing John is really from Florida he was telling the truth about th=
at. I dont think the document he=20
submitted for his chevy was fake either.=20

Just as Rick could probably tell you I am really from Ohio, from my email I=
P.=20

Another thing I will share with you is I do not beleive John to be a Russia=
n at all. John and I were=20

talking alot about the Constitution of the US. I had found a web site with =
the constitution and the bill=20
of rights I shared with him how I printed the whole document out and layed =
on my bed and read the whole=20
thing out loud to myself, his response to me was that made him very proud. =
He beleives strongly in the=20
Constitution and individual rights of people. He himself videotaped what wa=
s going on in the Florida=20
election. He is very much into this sort of stuff. Gathering and storing in=
formation. The stuff we talked=20
about in private has lead me to the conclusion that he DEFINITELY is NOT Ru=
ssian. Infact he may be more=20
American than any of us.=20

Another thing is people from England call their Mothers, mum. John has not =
called his mother mum not even=20
one time not even while talking in real time, so I do not beleive him to be=
 from England either.=20

You may not find a web site that John has because maybe he doesnt have one.=
 I don't have a web site either.=20
And I myself have not used my last name on web sites if I have posted I hav=
e always just used Pamela, or=20

Rick, I think it was a good idea you had in starting the Titor 2036 thread =

When, pray tell, is this supposed to happen and when may it be previewed.=
=20

If JT is gone, and the video is done... where for art thou. If JT is gone, =
and the video is "out of luck"=20
material then there will be serious scrutiny and heavy seas ahead.=20

Can anyone explain why it is JT required a chewy as part of the set? Or is =

And what on earth were those 'labels' on his picture for? One appeared to b=

If the internet is well and alive in 2036 and 'advanced' compared to today =
as claimed, that implies=20

 of print would not have=20

I continue to ponder Boomer's device...and I still come to the same conclus=
ion: it won't work as described.=20

I continued (by trick and device as necessary) to try to pin Boomer down to=
 some general idea of the mass=20
of his "micro-singularities" but was unsuccessful. The passenger side of hi=
s truck (in the photos) doesn't=20
seem to be squashed and the truck seems to be sitting level. The device wit=
h the singularities inside=20
probably weighs no more that 100 kg.=20

In an earlier post I threw out an absurd number for the size of the Schwarz=
schild Radius if the mass of the=20
singularities was that of a "small mountain"...I think that I said somethin=
g like one meter. No one=20
questioned that except Rick (Boomer suggested that the mass was much less t=
han what I proposed but didn't=20
question the numbers). It really was an absurdly large number. The Schwarzs=
child Radius of the Earth=20
collapsed to a black hole would be about 9mm.=20

Let's suppose that the mass of his singularities is 100 kg. The Schwarzschi=
ld Radius would be about=20

4.5*10 A -13 cm. Boomer says that the singularities are spinning and he pum=
ps electrons into it to expand=20
the radius. I'll give the devil his due and allow him to pump another 100 k=
g of electrons into the=20
singularities. The radius becomes 9*10 A -13 cm. And because they are spinn=
ing I'll allow him to expand the=20
radius one trillion fold to 9*10 A -1 cm (9mm). Oddly enough that's the sam=
e Schwarzschild Radius of the=20
Earth collapsed to a black hole. HOWEVER, there's a huge difference. Sittin=
g in the driver's seat one=20
meter away the gravitational effect on the driver is exactly the same as ha=
ving 200 kg of normal mass=20
sitting one meter away. It would have no more effect on the driver than the=
 motor block of the truck=20
sitting under the hood. Gravitation decreases as the inverse square of the =
distance from the center of=20
gravity.=20

But let me switch gears. Let's suppose that the machine worked as Boomer su=
ggests. The singularities sit=20
inside of his "black box". He starts it up and the singularities expand. Wh=
at is the first object affected=20
by the expanding event horizon? The device itself. Before Boomer is affecte=
d by the expanding=20
gravitational "distortion field" his device will lie wholly inside the Even=
t Horizon and be gone along=20
with its GVL, cesium clocks and battery before the field reaches him. The m=
achine might travel but Boomer=20
would be left behind with two unleashed singularities. (An event that he ad=
mitted would be disastrous=20
according to the IRC log on the Anomalies site.)=20

The theory of physics that he uses is somewhat based on scientific fact...b=
ut the engineering that he=20
suggests simply won't work.=20

Wonder Woman,=20

Forgive me for using one of Boomer's conventions as I respond to your last =
post:=20

(((Keep these details in mind when analyzing the functionality of the machi=
ne))=20

OK.=20

(((1. The singularity itself does not touch anything, it is suspended in a =
magnetic feild.)))=20

I don't think that I suggested that anything touches the singularity. It's =
the Schwarzschild Radius (event=20
horizon) that I was referring to.=20

(((2.The singularity is charged before it is captured, that is how the seco=
nd event horizon is formed,=20
positive-top spin.)))=20

An electron can be described as positive or negative top or bottom spin. Bu=
t an electron isn't a=20

singularity at the center of a black hole. How does one "charge" a singular=
ity given that any particle=20
that falls into it becomes part of the singularity? If it has a charge it's=
 composed of quarks. If it's=20
composed of quarks it isn't a singularity.=20

(((3.The gravity fields they create are combined and twisted.)))=20

OK. Boomer also creates a gratitational field as does the truck which combi=
ne with the fields. I don't see=20
how this addresses any of my issues.=20


371=20


(((4. The gravity between the singularity and the event horizons have diffe=
rent properties.)))=20

The statement doesn't make sense. The singularity does create a gravitation=
al field. That part of the=20
gravitational field where the escape velocity is just equal to the speed of=
 light is the event horizon.=20

The EH generates no field at all - it is the field (or a specific region of=
 it to be precise.)=20

(((5. They are controlled by overlapping and varying the energy between the=
m.)))=20

See #3. They either overlap or they combine. The fields are either in phase=
 (combine)or out of phase=20
(overlap). Phase coupling and phase cancellation has to be accounted for gi=
ven the following: we are=20
dealing with a relatively small mass(micro-singularities); the truck is mas=
sive and has numerous odd=20
shapes; differing areas of the truck have varying densities; the truck heat=
s and cools at differing rates=20
and thus expands and contracts at differing rates; Boomer is massive and it=
's unlikely that he sits=20
perfectly still during the "spin up". Each of these variables also twist an=
d warp the gravitational field=20
and do so unpredictably.=20

(((6. The machine is in the back seat when in operation.)))=20

OK. Front seat, back seat or on the roof.=20

A. None of the six points address how the device continues to function as i=
t is engulfed within the=20
expanding event horizon (from the portion of my post where I asssume that t=
he device can actually generate=20
a sufficiently intense gravitational field). "Inside the event horizon" mea=
ns no communication with the=20
outside - the device can't communicate information to Boomer and Boomer can=
't communicate with it. For all=20
intents and purposes it no longer exists.=20

B. Your post doesn't address the numbers that I posted. Boomer has consiste=
ntly stated that these are=20
micro-singularities. Micro-singularities have tiny masses and consequently =
tiny gravitational fields. His=20
singularities were made by colliding alpha particles (protons)in the CERN c=
ollider. True, if an object=20
closely approches the field the effects would be intense but not widespread=
.=20

C. As I posted, if I assume 200kg mass and sufficient angular momentum (spi=
n) and allow the impossible=20
expansion of one-trillion fold the EV becomes a "huge" 9mm radius field. Bo=
omer and the truck aren't going=20
to be sucked through the eye of a needle.=20

D. Boomer suggests that the "distortion field" to about 4 meters (15-16 fee=
t)with sufficient intensity to=20
suck him into the field from a distance of 1 meter as well as sucking the t=
ruck into the field at a=20
distance of about three meters. AND he says that neither he nor the truck f=
alls inside the Schwarzschild=20
Radius. He describes a field that has a Schwarzschild Radius of less than o=
ne meter; doesn't rip him apart=20
due to tidal effects and is still sufficiently intense at three times that =
distance (thus l/8th the=20
intensity) to also suck in the truck from front bumper to read bumper.=20

It won't work. Even if he danced on the head of a pin and managed to explai=
n away my "A." above there's no=20
way to explain way "D." Tipler time travel is accomplished by passing extre=
mely close to the EH from=20
specific angles. "Extremely close" does not include three Schwarzschild Rad=
ii from the center of gravity.=20

Hey - this is fun again! Debating the facts instead of flaming each other. =

As to the intensity of the gravitational field it decreases as the inverse =

I'm aware that "BHSCP" isn't completely accurate...that' s why I qualified =
the answer, "...gravitational=20
intensity decreases as the function of the inverse square of the distance" =
with the reference to classical=20
(Newtonian) physics. I assumed that the reader would know that classical ph=
ysics has its shortcomings.=20

The importance of the Rs...=20

I didn't choose the scenario here. Boomer did so...and he chose to put it i=
n terms of Tipler-based time=20
travel. By choosing that scenario he made the Schwarzschild Radius rather i=
mportant, didn't he? "Spinning=20
and skimming" (the event horizon) is the name of the game in Tipler time tr=
avel. As Boomer has described=20
the event, the field expands out to him and pulls him in with a force of 2g=
. If it's Tipler based then=20
he's just outside the event horizon when he's pulled in.=20

His device appears to be about one meter long, 25cm deep and 25cm high. Let=
's assume that you're right and=20
the engineers manage to keep the event horizon contained inside the device =
(discounting that parts of the=20
device would still fall inside the event horizon as it expands to the edges=
 of the enclosure). Let's say,=20
therefore, that the Schwarzschild Radius is 12.5cm (I assume the field to b=
e centered inside the=20
enclosure). Boomer is seated in the driver's seat. The device is in the bac=
k seat (as described by=20
Pamela). The device is about one meter away from Boomer's posterior and 1.2=
5 meters away from his anterior=20
(spine to belly-button &lt;wink&gt;. His back is about eight Schwarzschild =
Radii from the field and his front is=20
about ten Radii away. The front bumper of the truck (about three meters awa=
y) would be 24 Radii from the=20
field. This is far from "skimming" the event horizon. I can only conclude t=
hat for the effect to occur=20
then the Rs has to expand out to Boomer and engulf the device as it does so=
.=20

I can imagine one scenario that might avoid this effect. If the field is in=
itiated in the future and=20
collapses into the past it would pull Boomer in first and then pull the dev=
ice in last. In this case=20
Boomer would leave without the device and, according to him, have a 2.5% ch=
ance that the device would=20
never reach him again. That is not how he describes the event in any case.=

Something just struck me. I was thinking about the "event horizon"... The S=
chwarzschild Radius.=20

I know that according to conventional theory, when matter falls into the ev=
ent horizon, x-radiation is=20
produced, and indeed some astrophyscists have located what they believe to =
be black holes which do this=20
very thing.=20

What occured to me, was that this theory of using a "microsingularity" and =
by injecting electrons into the=20
Schwarzschild Radius would indeed, produce a LOT of x-radiation.=20

Just for a comparison - of sorts, consider older televisions, built in the =
1960s... they produced a vast=20
amount of x-rays. The way this occurred was thus: a cathode ray tube (CRT -=
 aka a picture tube) has=20
several thousand volts of electricity applied to it on the anode lead. (Tha=
t's the red lead that goes to=20
the back of the TV picture tube for anyone digging in the back of one right=
 now). That voltage was (in the=20
old days) roughly from 28 kv to 38 kv. At 32-35 thousand volts (somewhere i=
n there) the electrons inside=20
leaving the cathode and striking the phosphor screen hit with such "force" =
that it liberated energy in the=20
form of light from the phosphor. Further, x-rays were released as well. The=
 other place inside the TV that=20
X-rays were released was inside the "Diode" tube inside the high voltage po=
wer supply.=20

Either way it was produced, it was measureable. In recent years... since ar=
ound the mid to late seventies,=20
the voltages applied to the CRTs in TVs and computer monitors have been red=
uced to the 20 thousand volt=20
level to prevent the production of dangerous x-rays.=20

What all this is getting at is that x-rays can be produced by essentially s=
mall voltages, but then, if you=20
are talking about injecting electrons into the sphere of a black hole, then=
 you can produce xrays in the=20
same manner.=20

I still find it unbelievable that a "microsingularity" could exist. Here's =
why. By the very defination of a=20
singularity, it is implied there is a HUGE mass, into which all matter near=
 by is drawn. This massive=20
weight continues to grow in mass and gravity, thereby pulling in yet more m=
atter.=20

In other words, I can not fathom the existence of a "microsingulaity" - a b=
lack hole of finite mass and=20
volume (the size of an electron) into which electrons can be "injected" to =
cause changes in spin, fields=20
or whatever.=20

While the theory holds some water - I don't think it is enough to explain a=
way something like tipler=20

cylinders, what would have to be a severe gravitational mass in an enclosed=
 container, nor the amount of=20
x-radiation that would be produced.=20

Since at this point, we don't have enough knowledge of "physics" to state e=
mphatically that they CAN NOT=20
exist, I can only say that they probably do not exist. I've tried to convin=
ce a couple of physicists to=20
join up here, and try to explain what they know - but, they aren't willing =
to do so. They don't have the=20
time, energy or inclination to do so I guess. I'll keep trying.=20

If at the end of this thread our presumption is that the only way of time t=
ravelling is to produce "waves=20
of energy that transport back or forward in time" then we may have gained v=
ery little.=20

I feel that we have yet to isolate what 'waves' of what 'energy' is truly r=
equired as it would need to be=20
able to negate linear time somewhat like an accelerating rocket is used to =
negate gravity.=20

It seems to me as a basic principle that to counteract one agent (e.g. time=
, gravity) you must replace it=20
with an equal or greater counteragent (e.g. rocket fuel/engine).=20

So what is the counteragent here and what mechanism would drive it?=20

There's a lot of hyperlinks in the Titor's Prediction thread. Look at it th=
is way, if you can not build a=20
time machine using "particles" can you use a field that it creates to creat=
e waves of interference to move=20
through time. This wave stuff is more akin to the electro-magnetic radiatio=
n. It is a way that is being=20
discussed as taking over the 'particles' that physicists use now. Take that=
 a 'particle' is only a one=20
short instance of what really is going on, that the 'particles' are not rea=
lly particles except when we=20
freeze them in a moment of time by camera and fast shutter speeds, when you=
 look at the overall theory,=20
there are therotical physicists saying that the other physicists are not ta=
king into account the=20
'totality' of what is going on. That all supposed 'particles' in the bigger=
 whole are actually 'waves' of=20
electro-magnetic radiation. This phsyicist, David Bohm, is a protege of Ein=
stein.=20

And according to all accounts of the way we see, the way the brain works, t=
he way everthing seems to work,=20
is more akin (to explain consciousness and everything) to 'waves'. This is =
explained in the book "The=20
Holographic Universe". Now this theory is not complete, and may change, but=
 physicists are acuseing other=20
physicists of creating particles because they can not see below the Planck'=
s Constant which is where=20
theory is at now. To build an Particle Accelerator to actually see a 'quark=
' or smaller whatevers it would=20
take all the monies of all the tresuries of all countries and would have to=
 be so big as to build it out=20
in space, or else to confirm anything they have to wait for a space event t=
o prove anything. Remember,=20
below the electron, nothing is seen, it is just theory. The Planck's Consta=
nt is something like=20
0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 or 10 to the -39 power. Humans h=
ave nothing that can get below=20
that limit. So for a number of years it has been all theory and not much ca=
n be proved, including even=20
Superstring Theory. It is all guessing at this point. This new Holographic =
Theory explains more of=20
everything like the real world, and particles have nothing to do with it, j=
ust 'waves' of energy, which is=20
really what Einstein's formula is really about. So if they can not see belo=
w the 'limit' then who of the=20
scientists are really 'proving anything'.=20

Look at the other topic thread for hyperlinks to websites that explain some=

Now imagine that there are no 'particles' that what we preceive as 'particl=

coming together and splitting apart continually, depending how anything int=

imagine that John's TT machine is using 'forces' to change temporal displac=

interferrence pattern that develops into a type wormhole thing that allows =
him to move through some type=20
of 'temporal displacement' time.=20

This would use different type of formulas and different thinking from 'part=

not.and what were we going to do if they didnt beleive us.=20

Since I pondered the thought that I looked a little different in this time =
I also pondered wether anything=20
I told people would actually come true or not. I had no idea how far off th=
is world was from my own. the=20
world seemed slightly different, and I remembered a major event was more li=
kely to happen than a trivial=20
event... like ballgames won or lost.=20

We took the long bus ride to my friends house and started talking to the pe=
ople on the bus who questioned=20
our clothing. We finally ended up telling the people about Mad Cow disease =
since I studied alot about it=20
after John had told me and I knew quite a bit to tell them.=20

One influential person said she would write her congressman right away and =
have it investigated.=20

My friend looked at me with a worried look and I told the lady "Good!" beca=
use I was at a loss for=20
words."Maybe it won't be in the U.S then in the future,"=20

When we got to my friends house I was wondering if the father had a compute=
r.. I paused and looked at my=20
friend, "the internet existed during this time....right?"=20

I was thinking of all the wonderful inventions that I could tell my friends=
 parents would come in the near=20
future, then I stopped myself wondering how or if it would effect the world=
line.=20

then I woke up! But the dream made me realize how difficult it would really=
 be if you were a real time=20
traveler and you were not prepared for the time you were in.=20

Transcript:=20

"Greetings=20

I am the man you know as John Titor=20

Correction, I am one of the men you know as John.=20

In 1999, I was the second to arrive on the same worldlines the other man yo=
u know as John. It was I who=20
wrote the posts in November and January. When I return to 2001, I will writ=
e for the final time in March.=20
My Mother will release this message to you in November of 2009=20
The other John wrote the posts in December and February.=20

He, too, will write his final posts in March of 2001. As I write this now, =
the date is March 22, 2009, and=20
the divergence is 1.941=20

This is not the first time I have been in your future. I was here before wr=
iting the first posts in 2001. I=20
tried to warn you. I tried to wake you.=20

As time passes, I fear you will witness the transition from your apathy and=
 dependence, to your children's=20
fall into bondage. I feel sorry for you. You will not know the peace and fr=
eedom I will have when I return=20
home.=20

In spite of my efforts, the war that gave that gift to me may come to you m=
uch later.=20

To prove who I am a friend will corroborate the significance of the musical=
 group, the B-52s. I am sorry=20
about the strife and difficulty you have had these past years.=20

It was required.=20

As I said, after 1975, when I arrived in 1999, there was already another Jo=
n there. The two of us devised a=20
plan to return to separate worldlines.=20

The plan required that each of us travel to different time periods between =
1998 and 2009, and take=20
measurements with our displacement machine.=20

We had to find a way to communicate these measurements in a way that would =
last and could easily be found=20
later. Our first attempt was with the fax to Art Bell. I travelled to 1998 =
first, and left the first fax=20
with Art. The other John travelled there later and was able to find my fax.=
 He then left the second fax.=20

As the plan is now progressing, we were able to use the internet. The posts=
 we made and will make, are a=20
foundation we will need to get home. In each month we will post the measure=
ments we had made in various=20
time periods on different worldlines.=20

Every time someone posts about Jon Titor after 2001, they will become more =
permanent and easier for me, or=20
another Jon to find. If the other John, or even another John ever arrives i=
n your future.=20

If he were to ear this message, he will know what to do. The final measurem=
ents are on the website my=20
mother's attorney as overseen.=20

This is the reason we made the posts. With your help, they will last. They =
are a sign post to other Johns=20
who are lost, and need our work to return home.=20

For this I must thank all of you=20

The John Titor Legend: An Update from Pamela=20

https://mikesauve.com/2017/01/04/the-john-titor-legend-an-update-from-pamel=
a/=20


In Uncategorized on January 4, 2017 at 9:02 pm=20


After reading my book Who Authored the John Titor Legend? Pamela Moore reac=
hed out to me.=20

Pamela is described in the book as follows:=20

No poster interacted with John Titor as frequently or as intimately as Pame=
la Moore. In addition to being=20
one of the most frequent posters in both the Time Travel Institute and Post=
 to Post threads, she also=20
interacted with John over instant messenger (although never over the phone)=
 and claims to have shared a=20
deep bond with John.=20

Beyond this, Pamela also claimed that John Titor provided her with a "secre=
t song" that could be used to=20
verify anyone who'd come forward claiming to be John Titor. Most significan=
tly, she claims that John Titor=20
mailed her a piece of the IBM 5100 logo, and that while it came with no ret=
urn address, there was an=20
Orlando postmark.=20

The first thing Pamela set me straight on was that that she didn't converse=
 with John over Instant=20
Messenger, but rather in UFO-themed chat rooms. She also said that Titor ma=
iled her a part of the "IBM=20
5110 label" not the "IBM 5100 logo." Here's a helpful discussion of the dif=
ferences between the 5100 and=20
5110 models. She also sent me this picture of the label.=20



From there things grew considerably more interesting. First she clarified t=
hat the secret song John Titor=20
provided her with is not actually a B-52s song, which is widely believed, g=
iven that the inscribed copy of=20
John Titor: A Time Traveler's Tale sent to her by the John Titor Foundation=
 did include a B-52s song,=20
which she tells me, was the song Trism.=20

She has to leave=20

She has to go=20

The fastest way=20

Is by trism=20

Steps off the curb=20

Stella Corona hopes for the best=20

To be home by sunset=20

Gotta be home by sunset=20

She asked me to give her a ride=20

She said she had to go=20

Dropped her off by the trism=20

Through the atmosphere by prism=20

Go trism=20

Gotta keep movin'=20

Gotta, gotta keep on=20

It was a human race to get away=20

And then back again=20

Like the sun bends light through a prism=20

She bends herself through the trism=20

In the smokey streets of the night=20

She pulls the lever and then bright light=20

Trism=20

Trism=20

Trism=20

She points out how this song, "speaks of a man time traveling in the night =
and gives this girl a ride,=20
pulls the lever and sees bright light. This may correspond with the dream I=
 shared with him [that] I had."=20
She discussed this dream of hers in some length.=20

"Everyone thinks I started out asking John too many detailed questions when=
 he came in 2000. But the truth=20
was I had a detailed dream of a time traveler in 1998. I didn't know exactl=
y when I had the dream when I=20
started talking to John in the beginning but I remembered that dream. The q=
uestions I was asking him and=20
his answers are what I saw in the dream so I kept asking detailed questions=
. By then I was intrigued by=20
him. In my dream I was in a car time traveling with a man where what he des=
cribed [...] exactly matched my=20
dream. Later before he left he said he had to stop in April of 1998. I went=
 and grabbed my note book and=20
at the top was the date April 1998. My mouth dropped then I told John about=
 my dream."=20

What intrigued me most was something Pamela had to say about the faxes sent=
 to Art Bell in 1998 that bare a=20
strong resemblance to the John Titor story.=20

While these faxes provide a slightly different narrative than the John Tito=
r posts, there are many similar=20
aspects. Joseph Matheny, who has taken credit for the story, says they were=
 a proto-attempt at telling the=20
story. Others believe it could be an alternate John sent back from an alter=
nate 2036.=20

Pamela believes as follows:=20

"One thing about the faxes that was so bizarre is not one single person rem=
embered them in 2001 and yet=20
they were obviously only a few years old from 1998. No one made the connect=
ion when John was here. Not=20
even the diehard time traveler Art Bell fans. You'd think at least one of t=
hose people would have=20
remembered about them. They were not even found until John left. Like they =
magically just appeared in the=20
timeline."=20

She also discussed her ongoing relationship with the person claiming to be =
John Titor's mother, Kay,=20
facilitated entirely by Larry Haber:=20

"The latest package I received had several things in it. A letter from Kay.=
 A letter from John. An album=20
with a record inside and a CD with some songs on it but I'm keeping what wa=
s on it secret because I am not=20

really sure why he sent those to me. I more than likely will find out later=
. I received it in September=20

of 2016.=20

"Kay's letter was just a nice personal letter. Thanking me and apologizing =
she couldn't be more=20
communicative with me but fear kept her back. And that John wanted this pac=
kage sent to me before he left.=20

That's about all I feel I can reveal in her letter.=20

"John's letter was a two page letter in a separate sealed envelope. It was =
written on nice stationary in=20
pencil. With only the name Pam written on the outside. The first paragraph =
is as follows:=20

Dear Pam,=20

Over what has been fifteen years I've considered you to be a dear friend wh=
o deserves the best explanation=20
I can give. You should know that your efforts played an important role in a=
llowing me a chance to get=20
home."=20

"He then went on to explain how I was communicating with more than one John=
. That other Johns may arrive=20
and they need the posts to stay up as long as possible."=20

Pamela says this correspondence with John was written in a style similar to=
 the Letter 177 Tempus Edax=20
Rerum video that was posted to YouTube by Larry Haber.=20

"It sounded like the same person who wrote the letter also did the audio La=
rry Haber put up. The one that=20
starts out 'I am the man you know as John Titor....' I want to share it wit=
h others but I just don't know if=20
he would have approved of it. But if you heard that audio of a John Titor t=
his letter sounds very similar=20
and I think the same person who did the audio wrote the letter."=20

Pamela remains open-minded as to whether or not this was the original John =
she spoke to, an alternate John,=20
or someone else entirely.=20

"I have to say he does seem a little different than the John I spoke to. Bu=
t I honestly don't know what=20
that means. I am older. He may be a different age also. The John that I tal=
ked to before just seemed so=20
much closer to me. For example this John just ended his letter with 'thanks=
!' The other John ended his=20
final letter with 'I thank you from the bottom of my heart. You will always=
 be a true friend.' (That's=20
just an example I can't remember the exact words.) It's just different."=20


381=20



Is John Titor Back? Appearently He Just Emailed=20
Me...=20


http://www.paranoiamagazine.com/2014/06/in-john-titor-back-appearently-he-j=
ust-emailed-me/=20

Over the years one of the most enigmatic stories we have come across is Joh=
n Titor. Soldier, Time Traveler,=20
or Fraud? No one has been able to concretely determine which of those Mr. T=
itor was, but even to this day=20
people flock to his predictions, searching for relevance. The truth is that=
 many of the predictions have=20
not come to pass. The second civil war, the economic collapse all missing f=
rom our timeline but that's our=20
timeline. That's not to say another timeline didn't have those things.. Its=
 called the Butterfly effect=20
and Titor's very presence here and his conversations with Pamela and others=
 may have irrevocably adjusted=20
our timeline.=20

If it was a Hoax, RAI's Voyager TV Show probably did the best job of disman=
tling the Titor experience and=20
exposed Larry Haber and his brother as the ultimate architects of a John Ti=
tor deception. Are the Haber's=20
the source of John Titor or was he a real person? I'll probably never know =
so I keep an open mind and I=20
investigate people who claim to be Titor.=20

What is also interesting is that over the years I have been contacted many =
times by people claiming to be=20
John Titor. Some are outright frauds, but once and awhile you get an intere=
sting one which I publish to=20
let you the reader decide.=20

A few days ago "John D. Titor" contacted us and send me a URL for a Reddit =
posting. After checking it out,=20
it's an very interesting read so I present the initial posting below and a =
link to the rest of the thread=20
for the readers perusal.=20

The Original Posting:=20


One of my favourite things about being a writer is how perfect the public i=
s for this story. I love hearing=20
bold new ideas. I love your concepts and your creations. I want to know how=
 I can better this world. I ask=20
only for your time, and only for your words. I will try my hardest to liste=
n.=20

I come for one cause; to spread Peace, Love, Unity, Creation, and Knowledge=
, Truth, to ALL. And although it=20
may take me time, maybe my whole life, I forever stride to do just that; fo=
r the public good of Man.=20

NAMASTE.=20

I feel a great sadness, for I am born an American, not to this Country of t=
he USA, but to this Earth that=20
birthed Me. I am a true Native here, in the utmost sense; for I =E2=80=94 l=
ike everyone else =E2=80=94 was born of this=20
Earth, and shall continue to swim in its Seven Seas FOREVER. In my stay her=
e in the United States of=20

America, I see borders and tensions. Not just here, between the States, in =
our "democracy" and "republic",=20

but between people around the world. For good reason, maybe, I don't know. =
I just hope that one day, these=20

Men and Women around this globe will wake up to see that what befalls this =
Earth befalls EVERYONE. There=20

is no point in WAR; War is OVER, if YOU want it.=20

The Government is in the hands of The People, whether The Government =E2=80=
=94 not of this Country =E2=80=94 but of this=20
World, like or want to understand this. And as a friend of mine wrote; We t=
he People, in order to form a=20
more perfect Union, establish Justice, and ensure domestic Tranquility, pro=
vide for common defence,=20
promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselv=
es and our Posterity, do ordain=20
and establish this Constitution of the United States of America.=20

With this said, America will NEVER DIE, unless We, The People, not of this =
Country, but of this Planet,=20
accept the loss of domestic Tranquility, Liberty, and Freedom for ALL BEING=
S; for WE are ALL of the same=20
root; the same vein. And what we do to OTHERS, we only do to US.=20

Church is a FAMILY affair. It is a way for us to pay for those past and tho=
se to come; to pay our respects=20
to those we LOVE. My Muslim and Jewish brothers have sewn a great hate betw=
een themselves, for some think=20
they are righteous in their beliefs; God is righteous, man in his vain atte=
mpts at His Glory adopt a path=20
of self-righteousness. What Man SEWS, he REAPS. Know this: the son of Man i=
s not and will not be perfect,=20
not for a long time. God himself is perfect, else there would be no man to =
tremble before Him, and you=20
would simply not be here. This is a difficult concept for many people to be=
lieve, including myself. God=20
does not expect you to believe in Him. You will ALL KNOW Him =E2=80=94 soon=
 enough.=20

I am NOT a PROPHET. I do NOT speak for God, I speak on behalf of my self, l=
ike all other people. I do NOT=20
foresee at this point in time; I am just an Observer, and like every other =
Observer, I am capable of=20
mistake and error. But in those mistakes and error lie a great beauty, and =
I am always listening to=20
beauty, for it is in ALL things. On my religious stance, I am a Gnostic Chr=
istian, and I hail from the=20
same tribe as the Lion of Judah himself.=20

My first enactment would be a permanent ceasefire among all nations, if I w=
as capable of ordering this. My=20
second enactment would be Peace, Love, Unity, Creation, Knowledge, and Trut=
h for ALL. If ANYONE passes My=20
Field-Of-View, and We make Contact, I will ALWAYS extend a gesture of Good =
Faith. I have sworn to my self=20
to uphold this duty to my fellow Man, and I Hope that ALL Peoples and Gover=
nments rise up to this same=20
level of integrity.=20

You will ALL be but a faded memory, unless you take a good, long look in th=
e mirror. Within You exists the=20
most beautiful flower You will ever see; do not ever let it wilt, and take =
the beast within Your castle by=20
storm. Keep yourself strong, and you will forever be strong. Weep not for y=
our self; for you only cause=20
your self grievance. Weep for everyone else. The only thing that works is Y=
ou, You just have to find out=20
how to make it, when you have already been made.=20

The USA's debt WILL be repaid. What did Hercules do to the snake whose head=
 could not be cut off, because=20
it multiplied? HE BURNT IT.=20
