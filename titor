The First Fax (July 29,1998):=20

"Dear Art,=20 

I had to fax when I heard other time travelers calling in from any time pas= 
t the year 2500 AD. Please let=20 
me explain.=20 

Time travel was invented in 2034. Off-shoots of certain successful fusion r= 
eactor research allowed=20 

scientists at CERN to produce the world's first contained singularity engin= 
e. The basic design involves=20 
rotating singularities inside a magnetic field. By altering the speed and d= 
irection of rotation, you can=20 
travel both forward and backward in time.=20 

Time itself can be understood in terms of connected lines. When you go back= 
 in time, you travel on your=20 
original timeline. When you turn your singularity engine off, a new timelin= 
e is created, due to the fact=20 
that you and your time machine are now there. In other words, a new univers= 
e is created.=20 

To get back to your original line, you must travel a split second father ba= 
ck, and immediately throw the=20 
engine into forward without turning it off.=20 

Some interesting outcomes of this are:=20 

One, you meet yourself. I have done it often, even taken a younger version = 
of myself along for a few rides=20 
before returning myself to the new timeline and going back to mine.=20 

Two, you can alter history in the new universe that you have just created. = 
Most of the time, the changes=20 
are subtle. Sometimes, I'll notice car models that don't exist, or books th= 
at come out late.=20 

The oldest one was a skyscraper that wasn't built in a near favorite store = 
of mine in New York.=20 

Interestingly, when you travel in time, you must compensate for the orbit o= 
f the earth. Since the time=20 
machine doesn't move, you have to adjust the engines so you remain on the p= 
lanet when you turn it off.=20 

Unfortunately, it was also discovered that anyone going forward in time, fr= 
om my 2036, hit a brick wall in=20 

the year 2564.=20 

Everyone who has ever been there has reported that nothing exists. When the= 
 machine is turned off, you find=20 
yourself surrounded by blackness and silence.=20 

Now, most time travelers are trying to find out where the line went bad by = 
going into the past, creating a=20 
new universe, and proceeding forward to see if the same thing results in 25= 
64. It appears the line went=20 
bad around the year 2000. I'm here now, in this time, to test a few theorie= 
s of mine before going forward.=20 

Now, for the future you might want to know about.=20 

One, Y2K is a disaster. Many people die on the highways when they freeze to= 
 death trying to get to warmer=20 

weather .=20 

Two, the government tries to keep power by instituting marshall law, but al= 
l of it collapses when their=20 
efforts to bring the power back up fail.=20 

Three, a power facility in Denver is able to restart itself, but is mobbed = 
by hundreds of thousands of=20 
people and destroyed. This convinces most that maybe we shouldn't bring the= 
 old system back up.=20 

Four, a few years later, communal government system is developed, after the= 
 constitution takes a few=20 
twists .=20 

China retakes Taiwan, Israel wins the largest battle for their life, and Ru= 
ssia is covered in nuclear snow=20 
from their collapsed reactors.=20 

Art, the reason I'm here now is because I believe a nuclear weapon set off = 
by Iraq in the Middle East war=20 
with Israel might have something to do with the damaged timeline. I will te= 
st that theory and get back to=20 
you .=20 

Please pray that we discover the reason why there is no apparent future aft= 
er 2564."=20
